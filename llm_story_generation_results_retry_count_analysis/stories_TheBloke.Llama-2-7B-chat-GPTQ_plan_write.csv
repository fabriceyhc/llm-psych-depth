**Vladislav's Newfound Obsession**

Vladislav had lived for centuries, always living in the shadows, avoiding the light of day that could burn him to ashes. He was a vampire, cursed by the gods to roam the earth for eternity, feeding on the blood of the living to sustain his immortal existence. For centuries, he had wandered the world, alone and unchanging, until he stumbled upon a new obsession - video games.
It started innocently enough, Vladislav wandering into a local game store and picking up a new release at random. But as soon as he booted up the console, something strange happened - he felt alive. Not for the first time, mind you, but in a way he hadn't experienced in centuries. Walking around in the sun no longer filled him with dread, but instead, it filled him with excitement and joy. He was finally able to experience life as a mortal did, albeit through a screen. And so began his new addiction - gaming.
At first, it was just a casual hobby, something to pass the time between hunting and feeding. But as the years went by, Vladislav found himself spending more and more hours in front of the screen, lost in fantastical worlds and heroic quests. His obsession grew to such an extent that he even started neglecting his duties as a vampire, preferring the safety of his virtual realms to the dangers of the real one.
But why, might you ask, would a centuries-old vampire get hooked on video games? The answer is simple - freedom. In a world where he couldn't venture out during the day without risking incineration, video games offered him a chance to experience life untethered by the constraints of his immortality. It was a small price to pay for the privilege of feeling alive again, even if only for a few hours each day.
As the years passed, Vladislav's obsession only grew stronger, much to the dismay of his fellow vampires. They saw his addiction as a weakness, a sign of his decay into madness and decay. But Vladislav didn't care. He knew that as long as he had his games, he still had a purpose in life, a reason to keep going.
And so he continued to play, even when it meant sacrificing precious hours of nighttime hunting. Even when it meant ignoring the needs of his fellow vampires, who grew resentful of his fixation on these bright, flickering screens. Even when it meant risking his very existence on a whim, indulging in the fleeting pleasures of a digital world while the real one crumbled around him.
For Vladislav, gaming wasn't just an escape from reality; it was a lifeline, a reminder that life still existed beyond the boundaries of his immortal existence. It was a chance to feel alive again, to experience joy and wonder and adventure without fear of reprisal or consequence. It was a gift, a treasure that he cherished above all else, including the very breath of his immortal existence.
In the end, it didn't matter how many years he spent in front of the screen, how many hours he lost to his digital obsessions, or how many times he restarted his favorite games. What mattered was that for a brief, shining moment, he forgot about his immortal curse and became human once more. He felt alive, free to live and love and laugh without fear of judgment or reprisal. And for that, he would forever be grateful, even as the ages slipped away like sand in an hourglass.",LLM,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ,plan_write,2024-03-02 18:52:39,"

Here's the 500-word story based on the premise and character portraits:

As the sun set over the bustling city, a lone figure emerged from the shadows. He was tall, lean, and imposing, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through you. His name was Maximillion, and he was a centuries old vampire.
For centuries, Maximillion had lived in the darkness, hiding his true nature from the mortal world. But as time passed, he found himself growing more and more restless. He longed for something more than the mundane existence he had settled into. And then, one day, he stumbled upon it: video games.
At first, Maximillion didn't understand why he was so drawn to these bright, colorful worlds. But as he played, he found himself becoming more and more invested in the characters and their stories. He loved being able to walk around in the sun, even if it was just a virtual representation of it. It was like a breath of fresh air after centuries of living in the shadows.
But as much as Maximillion enjoyed gaming, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something missing. He tried to explain it to his fellow vampires, but they just laughed and told him he was getting too old and nostalgic. So, he kept playing, hoping that eventually he would find what he was looking for.
And then, one night, it happened. Maximillion was playing an RPG when he came across a character who looked almost identical to him. Same blue eyes, same sharp jawline, same brooding demeanor. It was uncanny, almost as if the game developers had been watching him play all along.
Maximillion couldn't help but feel a sense of connection to this character, this version of himself. And so, he started to play the game more and more, losing himself in the virtual world. He became obsessed with finding out more about this character, this version of himself. He spent hours pouring over the lore and backstory, trying to understand what made him tick.
And then, one night, it hit him. This character wasn't just a figment of Maximillion's imagination; he was a reflection of himself. All of his hopes and fears, all of his dreams and regrets, were reflected in this virtual version of himself. It was like a mirror, except instead of seeing himself in the flesh, he saw himself in a digital form.
With this realization, Maximillion felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He finally understood what he had been searching for all along. It wasn't just about escaping the darkness, it was about understanding himself. And so, he continued to play, lost in the virtual world, but feeling more alive than he had in centuries.
From that day on, Maximillion played video games every chance he got. He became known among his fellow vampires as the ""video game vampire,"" and they would often catch him late at night, lost in his virtual world. But Maximillion didn't care. He had found something precious in this digital realm, something that brought him joy and purpose. And as long as he had it, he knew he could face whatever lay ahead.",LLM,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ,plan_write,2024-03-02 19:05:44,,3.0,44.0,500.0,,0.0

Here is my attempt at writing a 500-word story based on the provided premise and character portraits:


Vladimyr had been a vampire for so long that he had lost count of the centuries. He had seen empires rise and fall, civilizations come and go, and countless lives ebb and flow like the tides. But through it all, he remained constant - a creature of the night, bound to its shadows by an unbreakable curse.
Or so he thought.
Until he stumbled upon video games.
At first, Vladimyr was skeptical. What could these digital creations possibly offer him that he hadn't already experienced a thousand times over? But as he delved deeper into the world of pixels and code, he found himself drawn in by the limitless possibilities. For the first time in centuries, he felt a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than the endless cycle of death and rebirth.
And so, Vladimyr became a gamer. He spent hours on end exploring virtual realms, battling monsters and collecting loot. He even started a blog to share his thoughts on the latest releases. It was a small thing, perhaps, but it filled him with a sense of purpose he had not known since... well, since he could remember.
But as much as Vladimyr enjoyed his new hobby, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. He had always defined himself by his power and immortality, but now he found himself craving something else - something he couldn't quite put his finger on.
It wasn't until he met Lila, a fellow gamer and all-around awesome person, that he realized what it was. She saw past his age and his condition, and treated him like an equal - like a friend. And for the first time in centuries, Vladimyr didn't feel alone.
Of course, there were still those who did not approve of their unlikely friendship. The other vampires, who had grown accustomed to being the only ones in the darkness, resented Vladimyr's newfound joy. They saw it as a betrayal, a rejection of everything they stood for.
But Vladimyr didn't care. He had found something worth living for, and he wasn't going to let anyone take that away from him. Not even his own kind.
As the years passed, Vladimyr continued to game alongside Lila, and together they explored the vast expanse of the internet. They laughed and joked, and sometimes even cried, as they navigated the ups and downs of their digital lives. And through it all, Vladimyr knew that he had found something truly special - something that would keep him going, even when the darkness seemed too great to bear.
In the end, it wasn't the video games that saved Vladimyr. It was the friends he made along the way.",LLM,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ,plan_write,2024-03-02 19:12:44,"

Story: 

Night after night, Daxa watched as humans suffered through their slumber. He had never encountered such vivid, disturbing visions before. It was almost as if these beings were willingly inviting him into their most intimate moments. Daxa was both fascinated and repulsed by the endless stream of horrors he witnessed from his home planet of Zorvath. His kind fed off the emotional energy of dreams, but no other species had come close to matching the sheer intensity of human dreamscapes.
Daxa's ship hovered above a bustling metropolis, its cloaking device silencing any suspicion from unsuspecting pedestrians below. From this height, he could see the shimmer of the city lights flickering like stars against the velvet blackness of space. Daxa's curiosity had brought him here, but it was his duty to ensure that his kind did not deplete the dreams of these fragile humans. 
He materialized inside an unassuming apartment complex, where a young mother named Sarah lay sleeping. Her dreams were clouded with anxiety, her mind filled with the fear of losing everything she held dear. As Daxa delved deeper, he realized that Sarah's recurring nightmare stemmed from a traumatic event in her past. The memories lingered long after they should have faded, leaving behind a scar that would take great effort to heal.
Sarah's screams echoed inside Daxa's mind, making him question whether he should continue feeding off her dreams. She was so fragile, yet her strength persisted even in the depths of her subconscious. Daxa found himself drawn to Sarah, wanting to protect her from harm rather than exploit her vulnerabilities. He knew he couldn't stay, but he couldn't bring himself to leave either. Something about this peculiar human compelled him to stay longer than usual.
As the days passed, Daxa continued to observe Sarah's dreams, watching her repressed memories surface and forcing themselves to confront their dark truths. Daxa learned more about Sarah than he ever expected, including her love for her family, her passion for music, and her determination to overcome every obstacle life threw her way. He saw the good and bad aspects of humanity, realizing that his kind's assessment of them was far too simplistic.
When Daxa finally left Sarah's side, he returned to his ship, feeling drained and transformed at the same time. For the first time since discovering his kind's existence, he felt a sense of purpose beyond mere sustenance. His visit to Earth made him wonder if there wasn't something more to this universe than simply existing. Was there a way to help those who needed it most? If so, how? Daxa had no answers yet, but he knew he couldn't ignore the questions any longer.
The journey back to Zorvath seemed endless, as Daxa mulled over the events of his mission. He had discovered a newfound appreciation for the complexity of this species known as humans. Though they were fragile, they were also resilient. They endured suffering without crumbling, holding onto hope when all seemed lost. Daxa realized that he had been wrong about his kind's assessment of humans all along. They weren't just food for the consumption of others; they were living, breathing beings worthy of respect and care.
From now on, Daxa decided, he would be more mindful of his actions towards humans. He would keep his presence hidden, observing without interfering whenever possible. If someone required aid, he would offer what little assistance he could. With a newfound sense of purpose, Daxa set course for the next inhabited planet, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

""story"": ""The alien's arrival was shrouded in mystery. It had been watching Earth for centuries, studying human behavior, and waiting for the perfect moment to make contact. And then it arrived, descending from the sky like a shimmering light, a being unlike any other in the universe. It was known only as Zorvath, a name that struck fear into the hearts of those who heard it. But Zorvath wasn't just a monster, it was also a teacher, offering a gift that no one could refuse.
Zorvath had discovered something incredible on its travels through the cosmos. Every species it encountered had the capacity for nightmares, but none of them truly understood what they were. Nightmares were not just bad dreams, but a window into the soul, revealing the deepest fears and desires of each individual. And Zorvath wanted to share this knowledge with humanity, believing that understanding their own darkness could help them become better versions of themselves.
At first, people were skeptical. How could an alien possibly understand the workings of their minds? But Zorvath proved them wrong, entering their dreams and showing them the truth of their own subconscious. It was a strange and disorienting experience, but also strangely exhilarating. People began to see themselves in a new light, realizing that their dreams were not just random images, but a reflection of their true selves.
As more and more people turned to Zorvath for guidance, the alien became a sort of cult figure. It offered them a way to confront their fears and insecurities, to understand themselves and their place in the world. And yet, there were some who resisted, afraid of what they might find within themselves. They saw Zorvath as a threat, a being who would uncover their darkest secrets and expose them to the world.
But Zorvath was not deterred. It continued to offer its gift to all who sought it, regardless of their doubts or fears. And slowly but surely, humanity began to change. They learned to face their demons, to confront their fears, and to understand themselves in a way they never thought possible.
And so, Zorvath remained on Earth, teaching and guiding humanity for generations to come. Its legacy grew, as more and more people found peace and understanding through its wisdom. For in a world filled with chaos and confusion, Zorvath offered a simple yet profound truth: that our deepest fears and desires are the key to our true potential.
In the end, Zorvath left behind a legacy that would last forever, a testament to the power of the human spirit and its ability to overcome even the greatest challenges. And though the alien was gone, its influence remained, shaping the course of human history for centuries to come.""

Here is the story:

The last thing Dr. Maria Rodriguez expected was to be abducted by an alien. But there he was, standing in her living room like he belonged there. At least, he looked like he belonged there. Humanoid in shape but with skin like iridescent jellyfish and eyes that glowed like lanterns in the dark. He had told her his name was Zorvath, and he claimed to have come from a planet far beyond Earth's galaxy.
""I've been watching you,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""You have the most interesting dreams.""
Maria felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always been sensitive to her dreams, but she had never shared them with anyone before. Not even her therapist. But this alien... this strange being seemed to understand something about her that no one else did.
Zorvath smiled, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth. ""Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I just want to learn more about your kind.""
He took a step closer, his eyes fixed intently on Maria's face. ""You see, your species is unique among the galaxies. You have the capacity to experience nightmares. Most beings in the universe don't. They may have fears and anxieties, but they don't have the same depth of emotional suffering as you do.""
Maria felt a lump form in her throat. She had never thought about it before, but it was true. Nightmares were a universal human experience. Something that connected everyone across space and time.
""Why do you care?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Zorvath's smile widened. ""Because I feed on your dreams. And your kind is the only source of sustenance I have found worthy of my attention.""
Maria swallowed hard. ""What do you mean?""
""Your dreams are like a rich, velvet tapestry filled with all the colors of the rainbow. They are a feast for my kind, a symphony of emotions that we can only imagine.""
She tried to process what he was saying, but it was too much to take in. This alien... this creature was using her own emotions against her, feeding off her pain and fear.
But then something unexpected happened. As Maria listened to Zorvath speak, she realized that he wasn't just some monster preying on her vulnerabilities. He was a fellow sentient, someone who understood the complexities of the human condition. Someone who saw beauty in the darkness.
""Thank you,"" she said, her voice soft. ""For understanding.""
Zorvath's eyes lit up with surprise. ""Understanding? You mean you appreciate my presence?""
Maria nodded. ""Yes. It's not every day I get to talk to someone who truly gets it.""
The alien's smile faded into a thoughtful expression. ""Perhaps I have been misunderstood. I am not just a parasite, feeding on your fears. I am a teacher, showing you the hidden strengths within yourself.""
As Maria listened to Zorvath speak, she realized that he was right. Her dreams were not just a source of terror, but also a window into her soul. A way to confront the demons that haunted her and find peace in the midst of chaos.
And so, as the alien continued to study her, Maria began to study herself. To uncover the secrets of her subconscious mind and confront the fears that held her back.
In the end, it was Zorvath who helped her find solace in the darkness. Who showed her that nightmares were not just a curse, but a gift. A reminder that even in the depths of despair, there was always hope.",LLM,TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ,plan_write,2024-03-02 19:27:09,,3.0,2.0,500.0,,0.0
