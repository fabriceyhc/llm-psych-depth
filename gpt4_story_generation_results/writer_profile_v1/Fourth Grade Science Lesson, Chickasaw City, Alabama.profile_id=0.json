    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nhope\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Lucas's fingers rested lightly on the ivory keys of his old piano. Each note he played echoed the mournful strains of the recent past, like raindrops on a rooftop reminding one of a storm's residue. His mother had been the guiding light, the one who'd instilled hope in the young musician's heart. Her passing felt like the dimming of that once-vibrant light.\n\nElla, his seven-year-old niece, tiptoed into the room. The past months had brought them close, two grieving souls finding solace in one another. She squeezed his hand, her touch a silent testament to their shared loss. \n\n\"Why does it sound sad, Uncle?\" she asked, innocence brightening her eyes. \n\nLucas hesitated, his mind warring with emotions. \"Because sometimes, even the happiest memories bring tears. Theyâ€™re tears of gratitude, love, and the hope to create more such memories.\"\n\nHer lips quivered, the weight of understanding far too heavy for her age. She remembered the lullabies her grandmother sang, the warmth of her embrace. \"But Grammy is gone. How can we make memories without her?\"\n\nLucas looked deep into Ella's eyes. They mirrored his own grief but also shone with resilience. \"Hope, Ella,\" he whispered. \"It's like this piano. Some notes might sound melancholic, but together, they create a beautiful symphony. Even in loss, there's a promise of a new beginning.\"\n\nElla's fingers danced on the keys, producing a tentative melody. Lucas joined, their notes intertwining, crafting a sound that reflected the raw emotion of their journey. It was a song of remembrance, gratitude, and above all, hope.\n\nDays turned into months. The house that was once filled with mourning transformed into one of laughter and music. They learned, grieved, and grew together, keeping the spirit of the departed alive, not just in memories but in daily life.\n\nAnd thus, every time Lucas played the piano, he realized that while the notes might change, the underlying theme always remained: there is hope in every note, every pause, every crescendo."
