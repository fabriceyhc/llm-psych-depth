    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nfarewell, 2nd person\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "You turn away, gazing at the horizon. Every setting sun brings with it a heartbreak of its own, and you know this is one you'll always remember. It's in the way the wind carries the weight of goodbyes, in the trembling of your hands as you try to pen down one final letter.\n\nDo you remember when you first met? The world was so much simpler then. Eyes filled with wonder, you had introduced yourself, a tapestry of dreams and aspirations spilling out. They listened, nodding, smiles playing at the corner of their lips, understanding every fragment of your soul.\n\nBut life has a unique way of unfolding. Just as trees shed their leaves, humans shed layers of themselves. Some transformations are beautiful, others painful. You watched them grapple with their internal tempests, fight with shadows of their past, and rejoice in fleeting moments of serenity. It made them feel... real. It made you feel. The ebbs and flows of their life stories so mirrored your own that it sometimes scared you. But it was that depth, that authenticity, which drew you in even more.\n\nYou had danced under the stars, cried in each other's embrace, and laughed at life's little ironies. The narratives you both shared, so intertwined, they sometimes felt like a single string. Their complexities, their imperfections made the journey more enriching. A journey where you were both the protagonist and the spectator.\n\nYet now, as the last chapter approaches, you feel a tightness in your chest. Emotions, raw and unfiltered, flood in. Longing. Desperation. Acceptance. You wish to hold onto every memory, keep it close, savor it till it's a part of you.\n\nThe letter is done. You seal it, placing it where they'd surely find it. As you walk away, your steps heavy, you hope they'd understand. You hope they'd know that you're not leaving them, just a part of your journey. It’s the universe’s way – farewells are but a prelude to new beginnings.\n\nThe dusk settles in, the horizon a mix of fiery oranges and somber grays. In the tranquility, there's a silent promise. That stories don't end, they evolve. And even if paths diverge, the journey shared will always be a part of the grand narrative.\n\nDo they remember? You think they do. For in every tear shed, in every joyous moment, in every echoing laughter and comforting silence, they are there. With you. Always."
