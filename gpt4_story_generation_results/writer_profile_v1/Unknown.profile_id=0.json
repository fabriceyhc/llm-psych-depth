    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nfear, thriller, suspense\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "The flickering streetlights cast intermittent pools of gold upon the empty streets. Beneath one of these lights, Vanessa stood trembling, her heart racing, eyes darting from shadow to shadow. An innocuous letter had brought her here, with just one phrase written on it - 'Come if you dare'. Vanessa was never one to back down from a challenge, but the stillness of the night and the whisper of the wind evoked a primal fear within her.\n\nVanessa's footsteps echoed as she continued to walk, trying to shake off the unease. Every minute, the oppressive silence of the night seemed to close in on her, amplifying even the most minor of noises. The rustling leaves transformed into sinister murmurs, and the distant footsteps felt like someone stalking her.\n\nAs she passed by an old abandoned building, its shattered windows seemed to stare at her. It was said to be haunted. Legends told of a woman who once lived there, heartbroken, spending her days and nights writing letters to her lover who never returned. Some claimed to have seen the shadow of a woman in the window, still waiting, still hoping. Drawing a deep breath and emboldening herself, Vanessa stepped inside.\n\nWithin the dilapidated building, she discovered an old desk covered in dust, with scattered letters all around, each sealed and never sent. One letter caught her eye, its edges singed as if touched by fire. It read: 'Even in death, I cannot find peace, waiting, always waiting for you'. Vanessa felt a cold shiver down her spine, realizing the depth of the despair this soul endured. Even though a century separated them, Vanessa could feel the raw emotion, the depth of love and anguish, and it tore at her heart.\n\nSuddenly, a whisper echoed around her, 'Who are you? Why have you come?' The voice was soft yet filled with pain. Without a second thought, Vanessa responded, 'I'm here to listen, to understand'. In that moment, a connection was forged. The spectral figure appeared, an ethereal woman in period clothing. Vanessa, though filled with fear, felt a pull of empathy. This was a soul trapped in perpetual sorrow.\n\nAs dawn approached, Vanessa and the spirit spoke, sharing stories of love, loss, and hope. When the first rays of the sun filtered through the broken windows, the spirit seemed at peace, her chains of despair broken. She whispered, 'Thank you for setting me free', and disappeared, leaving Vanessa alone, but profoundly changed.\n\nThe experience haunted Vanessa for days. Not because of the supernatural, but due to the intense human emotions she had encountered. The depth of love, the pangs of separation, and the liberation of understanding and empathy left an indelible mark on her psyche.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Vanessa decided to restore the old building, turning it into a sanctuary for those in need of understanding and a listening ear. Sometimes, the most profound encounters are not with the living but with the souls who have long departed, yearning to be heard and understood."
