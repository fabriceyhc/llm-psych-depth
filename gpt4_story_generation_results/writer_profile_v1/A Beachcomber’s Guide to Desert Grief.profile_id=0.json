    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\ngrief, feeling\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "In a town enveloped by the memories of people who had passed, Marianne walked the quiet lanes with a profound heaviness in her heart. The depth of her grief had carved out a cavern so deep, it seemed bottomless. Everyone around her seemed to fade away, becoming just voices amidst the clamor of her sorrow.\n\nShe often found herself at the old bridge, the very spot where she had felt the most genuine laughter with David, her late husband. The air here was thick with the scent of daisies. David used to pick them up, tucking one behind her ear, his fingers lingering, transmitting warmth that melted her anxieties.\n\nOne chilly evening, as Marianne gazed into the gently flowing waters below, she felt a hand on her shoulder. Turning around, she saw an old woman with gray hair cascading down her frail shoulders, her eyes carrying stories of a thousand lifetimes.\n\n'I've seen you here often, child,' the old woman whispered, her voice soft yet carrying a certain strength. 'Grief is a heavy cloak, isn't it?'\n\nMarianne's voice wavered, but she nodded, a single tear tracing its path down her cheek. She felt a surge of emotions, a mix of longing, anger, and a tinge of regret. The weight of her feelings was a tangible presence between the two women.\n\nThe elderly lady continued, 'Our town is a haven for souls like yours. But remember, dear, grief is also a journey. It's okay to feel lost, to feel numb. Just don't let it anchor you forever.'\n\nAs the sun started to set, painting the skies with hues of purple and gold, Marianne felt something shift within her. It wasn't happiness or resolution, but a sliver of acceptance. For the first time since David's passing, she didn't feel entirely alone in her grief.\n\nAnd as days turned into weeks, Marianne found herself engaging more with the world. She joined the old woman, Clara, in her daily walks, discovering stories of love, loss, and rebirth. Each tale was an exploration of emotions that ebbed and flowed like the tides, each emotion more intricate than the last.\n\nMarianne realized that grief wasn't a solitary journey. It was intertwined with moments of joy, laughter, and understanding. By embracing it, she wasn't leaving David behind; she was carrying his love and memories into her new life, creating a complex narrative that transcended time."
