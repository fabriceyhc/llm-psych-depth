    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nfamily, relationship\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "There's a worn-out photograph that sits on the corner of Grandma's fireplace. A moment frozen in sepia tones, where three figures, framed by gnarled tree branches, stand at varying heights. The tallest, a proud man with a full beard; to his left, a graceful woman with twinkling eyes; and at the center, a young boy, his innocence unmistakable.\n\nNina gazed at the photograph as she always did during her visits, her fingers tracing the edges of the glass frame. The woman in the photograph, her mother, had a look Nina had never known — a look of boundless joy and fulfillment.\n\nIn hushed whispers, neighbors often spoke about the tragedy of the car crash, a cruel winter's night when icy roads snatched two lives. Nina, only three at the time, was left in the arms of her grandmother. And as years drifted by, the memory of her parents became vague, blurred impressions shaped more by the stories she'd been told than actual recollections.\n\nOne afternoon, while Grandma was in the garden, Nina ventured into the attic, a place of forgotten history. Among the dusty trunks and ancient garments, she found her mother's diary. The pages were filled with delicate cursive, detailing everyday moments, hopes, and fears. As she read, Nina found herself on a journey of rediscovery.\n\nThe diary spoke of love and challenges; of disagreements between the couple about future dreams and immediate realities. There was a particular entry, where her mother had described a heated argument about relocating for her father's job. The dilemma was palpable - a clash between love for a partner and love for a familiar world. The resolution wasn't immediate. It was a series of discussions, compromises, and mutual respect that eventually found them a middle ground.\n\nBut what stood out the most were the moments of tenderness; when her father surprised her mother with a sketch he’d made of their family under the gnarled tree, or when they stayed up late, rebuilding their son's broken toy castle.\n\nNina could feel the pulse of the words, the raw emotions, the layers of love and strife that constituted their relationship. And in that attic, the diary bridged the chasm of years and memories, letting Nina touch a facet of her parents she had never known. \n\nThe sun had started its descent when Nina emerged, clutching the diary to her chest. As she walked into the garden, Grandma looked up, her gaze resting on the diary.\n\n\"You've met them, haven't you?\" Grandma's voice trembled with emotion.\n\nNina nodded, tears streaming down her face. In that shared moment, two generations connected, not just by blood, but by an intricate tapestry of love, loss, and the resilience of family."
