        "Alex: The person who wakes up in the middle of the night. Alex is a pragmatic individual, who often surprises people with their unconventional ways of handling situations. Upon feeling the grasp, Alex's immediate thought isn't fear but rather a calculated method of establishing control. Alex has a history of confrontations, and this method of immediate dominance has served them well. Deep down, Alex is scared but chooses to face fears head-on, believing it's the best way to overcome them.",
        "The Unseen Entity (Mara): A creature from a dimension not known to humans. Mara is curious about humans and their world. It didn't intend to scare Alex but wanted to establish a connection. Mara is anxious and uncertain about this new world, and the sudden grip from Alex has left it even more bewildered. It contemplates whether it should reveal itself or retreat to its realm.",
        "Jamie: Alex's roommate who slept through the initial encounter. Jamie is a light sleeper but is known to be heavily skeptical of the supernatural. Upon hearing the story, Jamie's mind races, oscillating between genuine concern for Alex and the suspicion that it might be just another dream. Jamie's internal struggle revolves around reconciling their logical mind with the very tangible fear emanating from their friend."
