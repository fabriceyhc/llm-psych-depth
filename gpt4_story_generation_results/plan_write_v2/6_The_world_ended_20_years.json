'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob' 'You know what to do at the beep' until one day 'Hello...hello? Oh my God hello!'\n\n\nTask: Based on the premise, describe the names and details of 2-3 major characters. Focus on each character's emotional states and inner thoughts.\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"character_list\": {\"title\": \"Character List\", \"description\": \"character list\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"character_list\"]}\n```\n",
    "character_list": [
        "Name: Alex\nAge: 40\nPhysical Appearance: Tanned skin, rugged beard, lean physique, and weary blue eyes from years of solitude. Often wears a weathered leather jacket and faded jeans.\nEmotional State: A blend of loneliness, resilience, and hope. He finds solace in the voicemails, as they serve as a connection to the world he once knew.\nInner Thoughts: Alex often reflects on his past and the people he lost. Although the voicemails provide some comfort, the constant solitude leads him to question his sanity and purpose. The message from the real person reignites a spark of hope within him.",
        "Name: Cindy\nAge: Message suggests late 20s when the world ended, so possibly late 40s now.\nPhysical Appearance: Unknown from the voicemail. But one can imagine shoulder-length wavy hair, a freckled face, and a voice filled with youthful optimism.\nEmotional State: Cindy's voicemail brings a sense of nostalgia. Her cheerful greeting serves as a contrast to the bleak world outside.\nInner Thoughts: From the voicemail alone, Cindy seems like someone who embraced life with joy and hoped people would connect with her through her message.",
        "Name: The Unknown Caller\nAge: Indeterminable from the message. Possibly mid-40s.\nPhysical Appearance: Unknown, but the voice is filled with desperation and relief.\nEmotional State: Elation mixed with disbelief. This person has been searching for any sign of human life, just like Alex.\nInner Thoughts: The Unknown Caller has faced their share of despair. The act of finding Alex's ingenious system and hearing someone else's voice has given them renewed hope and purpose. They may have been about to give up before this connection."
