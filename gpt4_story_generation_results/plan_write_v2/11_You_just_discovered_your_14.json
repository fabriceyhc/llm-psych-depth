Lily is both fascinated and scared of her newfound power, often questioning if she's truly meant for this role. Deep down, she's still a child who yearns for a normal life, but there's a budding sense of responsibility and determination. In moments of solitude, she ponders about the balance of being a hero and a regular teenager, and fears for her safety.",
        "Alex: Lily's protective parent, who stumbles upon the Moon Princess locket. Initially, Alex feels a mixture of anger and fear â€“ anger at the Moon Goddess for entrusting such a dangerous task to a child, and fear for Lily's safety. They are determined to confront the Moon Goddess, driven by a protective instinct. Although Alex knows they can't stop their daughter from embracing her destiny, they secretly hope to find a way to make it less perilous for her.",

She is confident in her choice but is not impervious to emotions. When confronted by Alex, she feels a tinge of guilt and understanding, wishing she could alleviate the worries of a parent. Yet, she stands firm on her decisions, believing it's for the greater good."
