        "Jamie: A mid-30s individual who has been dealing with severe depression. Lost a significant job, dealt with a tough breakup, and has been feeling isolated. Recently, Jamie was provided a service dog to help cope with the depression. Despite being consumed by a fog of sadness, Jamie feels a newfound sense of purpose in caring for their service dog. The daily responsibilities and understanding of the dog's own depression become the main reason Jamie pushes forward each day. Jamie's thoughts revolve around ensuring the dog's happiness, even on their worst days. They find solace in being needed and strive to make life better for their furry companion.",
        "Buddy: The service dog that was supposed to help Jamie but is in fact, even more depressed. Buddy's previous owner passed away, leading to a deep sense of loss and melancholy. Every day feels heavy for Buddy, but Jamie's presence and unwavering support provide moments of solace. Buddy often looks up at Jamie with eyes that seem to say 'I know you understand'. Buddy's thoughts are clouded with memories of the past, but he occasionally finds happiness in simple things, like a gentle pet from Jamie or a moment under the sun.",
        "Taylor: Jamie's close friend who works at the service dog organization. Taylor recommended the service dog to Jamie in the first place and later realizes the mix-up. Consumed by guilt, Taylor constantly checks on Jamie and Buddy. They aim to rectify the situation, but Jamie insists on keeping Buddy. Taylor's thoughts are often filled with worry for both Jamie and Buddy, but they're also Jamie's pillar of strength, offering advice, companionship, and an understanding ear."
