For twenty years, Alex wandered the desolate world, hoping to find another soul. He bore the weight of his solitude with a mixture of resignation and resilience. Each night, he'd huddle next to a makeshift fire and call voicemails, just to hear a human voice. 'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob...' These messages served as his only tether to the world he once knew.

Alex's fingers ran through his rugged beard as he played Cindy's voicemail. Her voice was filled with the bubbly optimism of a time before the world's end. The message brought a smile to his weary blue eyes, even after all these years. He often imagined Cindy with her wavy hair dancing in the wind, freckles dotted across her cheerful face. Sometimes he'd reply to the voicemails in his head, pretending there was someone at the other end listening. 'Hey Cindy, it's Alex. Remember that sunset we never saw together?'

But reality had a way of pulling him back. The charred landscapes and empty cities were constant reminders of his loneliness. Each day, he questioned his sanity, wondering if he'd be better off if he just let go and joined the quiet stillness around him. Yet, something within him refused to give in, some sliver of hope that whispered he wasn't alone.

One evening, as he dialed another familiar number, an unfamiliar voice answered. 'Hello...hello? Oh my God, hello!' The voice was filled with a mix of desperation and relief.

Alex's heart raced. He fumbled with the device, disbelieving. 'Who is this?' he croaked.

'I don't know where I am, or how this thing works. But I've been looking for someone, anyone. Please, say something!'

It was the voice of the Unknown Caller, a person who, like Alex, had faced the abyss of solitude and was teetering on the edge. This unexpected connection was a lifeline they both desperately needed.

'You're not alone,' Alex whispered, his voice filled with emotion. 'I'm here. We'll find each other.'

For the first time in two decades, Alex felt a sense of purpose stronger than mere survival. The world may have ended, but in this moment, hope was reborn.
