John shuffled through the dusty attic, looking for a misplaced folder. His hand brushed against a tarnished frame. As he blew away the layers of dust, his heart constricted. The image showcased two identical smiling girls, one with a small scar just below her right eye, the other unblemished. Linda had the same scar.

His mind raced back to all the evenings Linda would sit by the window, gazing at nothing, her usual cheerful demeanor replaced by a melancholy he didn't understand. And then, there were moments when she'd do things out of character – humming a tune he’d never heard before or expressing an opinion she’d never voiced. He had assumed grief manifested in strange ways. But the picture in his hand gnawed at him, suggesting a more sinister reality.

Linda walked into the room, her eyes widening as she saw the photograph in John's hands. 'Where did you find that?' she whispered, voice shaky.

'In the attic. Linda... why didn't you tell me about Rebecca?' John's voice trembled with confusion.

Linda took a deep breath. 'Rebecca was my twin. We were inseparable, always mimicking each other. But we had a massive falling out years ago, and I tried to forget about her. I wanted to shield you from that part of my past.'

'Why the estrangement?' John probed.

Linda hesitated, then confessed, 'We fell in love with the same man once. It tore us apart. When the relationship ended, I was left with him and she... she felt betrayed. We never spoke after that. I always hoped to reconcile, but I guess fate had other plans.'

John tried to wrap his head around it. 'But these habits, these moments of... dissociation?'

'Every time I look in the mirror, I see her,' Linda's voice broke. 'It's like living with a ghost. I sometimes become her, act like her, maybe in hopes of reliving those lost moments.'

As the truth settled, John pulled Linda into an embrace. They both mourned the lost connection and the haunting memories that refused to fade. While the specter of Rebecca would always linger, they found solace in each other's arms, a sanctuary against the ghosts of the past.
