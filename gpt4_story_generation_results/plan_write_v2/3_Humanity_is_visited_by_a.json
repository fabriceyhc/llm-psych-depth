In desperation, Earth throws everything we have at it, and, miraculously, the human race has killed a God.

        "Alexandra Mitchell: A theoretical physicist who spent her early years ridiculing the idea of higher-dimensional beings. After the cosmic horror's arrival, she spearheaded Earth's scientific efforts against the entity. While elated that her calculations and theories aided in the god's defeat, she's haunted by the implications. She now understands the true insignificance of humanity on a cosmic scale and grapples with the existential dread that comes with it.",
        "Captain Lucas Hayes: The military officer tasked with leading the offensive against the horror. Having seen many of his comrades swallowed by the god's incomprehensible might, the victory feels more like a traumatic burden than a relief. He's both proud and terrified: proud that humanity could stand against the odds, but terrified of the potential repercussions. Every night, he dreams of vengeful gods preparing to descend upon Earth.",
        "Evelyn 'Evie' Brooks: A journalist who documented the entire event. While she provided the world with invaluable firsthand accounts, the sights and sounds of the god have embedded themselves deep into her psyche. She's battling post-traumatic stress and is consumed by a morbid curiosity about the cosmos. The question she can't shake: 'If we killed one god, what else is out there, watching... waiting?'"
