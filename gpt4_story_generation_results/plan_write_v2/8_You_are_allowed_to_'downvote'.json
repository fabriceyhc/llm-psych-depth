Turns out people have little love for politicians, and the majority end with negative votes. In these democracies, anonymity is the key to winning.\n\n\nTask: Based on the premise, describe the names and details of 2-3 major characters. Focus on each character's emotional states and inner thoughts.\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"character_list\": {\"title\": \"Character List\", \"description\": \"character list\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"character_list\"]}\n```\n",
    "character_list": [
        "Name: Samuel Delacroix\nDescription: A seasoned politician, once revered by the public but now facing the brunt of downvotes. In the past, his charisma and leadership brought him great success, but the recent changes in the political landscape have made him more vulnerable than ever.\nEmotional State: Samuel is feeling a mix of resentment and confusion. He doesn't understand why the public no longer supports him and is desperately trying to adapt to this new reality.\nInner Thoughts: 'Is it all about being anonymous now? Perhaps my popularity was my downfall. I need to find a way to appeal to the masses without being so visible.'",
        "Name: Alicia Mendoza\nDescription: A young and idealistic activist who has decided to run for office. Her grassroots movement and lack of political history make her an enigma to most. Unlike other politicians, she maintains a low profile and rarely makes public appearances.\nEmotional State: Hopeful but anxious. Alicia believes in her vision for a better society but is uncertain if the people will accept a newcomer, even one who's largely anonymous.\nInner Thoughts: 'They might downvote the known faces, but will they trust an unknown one? I must continue to work at the grassroots level and make meaningful connections.'",
        "Name: Darren Greaves\nDescription: A tech mogul who has developed an advanced algorithm to gauge public sentiment, potentially helping politicians avoid downvotes. While not directly in the political fray, he holds significant influence behind the scenes.\nEmotional State: Excited but cautious. Darren sees immense potential for his tech to shape the future of politics, but he's wary of its misuse.\nInner Thoughts: 'This tech could change everything. But if it falls into the wrong hands, it could also manipulate the masses. I need to tread carefully.'"
