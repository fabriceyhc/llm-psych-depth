        "Alex: Recently deceased and the newest arrival in this afterlife. Initially overjoyed with the serene and peaceful environment, Alexâ€™s heart sinks upon realizing that this is, in fact, hell. Emotionally, Alex is confused and in denial, constantly wrestling with the juxtaposition of the calm environment and the label of 'hell'. Inner thoughts revolve around figuring out what he did wrong in life and why this hell seems unlike any hell he had ever heard of.",
        "Lilith: The concerned demon who pays Alex a visit. Contrary to typical demon stereotypes, Lilith is empathetic and genuinely seems distressed that Alex has ended up here. She appears to be a case worker of sorts for new arrivals. Emotionally, Lilith carries the weight of hundreds of souls she oversees and feels genuine sadness when one of them is 'misplaced'. Her inner thoughts often revolve around the flawed nature of the afterlife system and her wishes to help souls find peace.",
        "James: An older resident of this hell who becomes Alex's unofficial guide. James has been here long enough to see countless newcomers grapple with their new reality. He has accepted his fate and has become a pillar of support for others. Emotionally, James has moved past the initial shock and is in a state of acceptance. He feels a sense of responsibility for newcomers and tries to ease their transition. His inner thoughts often revolve around memories of his past life and his curiosity about the nature of this peculiar hell."
