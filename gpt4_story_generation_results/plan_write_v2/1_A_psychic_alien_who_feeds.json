        "Xeran: An ageless psychic alien from a distant galaxy. Having fed on the dreams of countless beings, Xeran is intrigued and shocked to discover that humans experience nightmares. This presents a novel and addicting flavor, a rush he hasn't felt in eons. However, he also becomes concerned when he realizes the pain and trauma behind these dark dreams. Xeran grapples with the moral implications of feasting on such raw, painful emotions. Internally, he's torn between his hunger and newfound empathy towards humans.",
        "Aria: A 27-year-old woman who suffers from recurring nightmares due to a traumatic incident from her childhood. She is sensitive, introspective, and initially unaware of Xeran's presence. Over time, she becomes aware that her dreams are being watched and feels a strange connection with the alien entity. Battling her own fears, she becomes curious about the being feeding off her nightmares, leading her to confront her own past and the emotional scars she's carried for years.",
        "Dr. Nolan Keats: A renowned dream researcher, obsessed with understanding the human subconscious. When strange phenomena start to occur in his dream studies, notably with Aria's nightmares, he becomes deeply involved in investigating the cause. Skeptical at first, his world view is shaken upon discovering Xeran's existence. Nolan struggles with the desire to scientifically document the alien's presence and the ethical dilemmas of exploiting Aria's trauma for scientific gains."
