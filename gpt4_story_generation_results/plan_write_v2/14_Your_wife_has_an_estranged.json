        "John: John is the husband who made the chilling discovery of the family photo. Initially, John's emotional state was one of pure concern and sympathy for his wife. However, after discovering the old photograph, he's ridden with anxiety, confusion, and doubt. The thought of not really knowing who he's been with this entire time weighs heavily on him. Every movement and word from his wife starts to look suspicious to him, and he's caught in a dilemma - should he confront her, or seek out the truth silently?",
        "Linda: Linda is the wife who was married to John. Before her sister's death, she was vivacious, loving, and always cheerful. However, post the tragic incident, she seems more distant, occasionally lost in thought, and displays peculiar habits that John hadn't noticed before. Deep down, Linda feels an immense void due to the loss of her twin sister, and part of her feels as though she lost a piece of herself. There are also memories and secrets about her relationship with her twin that she hasn't shared with anyone.",
        "Rebecca: Rebecca is Linda's deceased twin sister. Even though she doesn't physically appear in the story, her presence is deeply felt. Before her mysterious death, she was the more rebellious and free-spirited twin. Their estrangement was caused by a fall out over something neither of them wanted to address. Rebecca's emotional state before her death was one of regret and longing to reconnect with Linda, a chance she never got."
