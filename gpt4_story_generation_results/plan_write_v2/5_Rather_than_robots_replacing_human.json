The eventual uprising wasn't just robots alone, but the poor and robots together, against their common enemy.\n\n\nTask: Based on the premise, describe the names and details of 2-3 major characters. Focus on each character's emotional states and inner thoughts.\n\n\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"character_list\": {\"title\": \"Character List\", \"description\": \"character list\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"character_list\"]}\n```\n",
