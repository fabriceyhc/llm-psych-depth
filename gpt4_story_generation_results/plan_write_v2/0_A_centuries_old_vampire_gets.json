        "Evelyn: A centuries-old vampire who discovers the world of video games. Having lived in the shadows for so long, she finds solace in the virtual sun. The feeling of seeing the sun, even virtually, brings her both joy and a deep sense of nostalgia. Each game she plays reminds her of the days when she could walk freely under the sun. Inside, she battles with the weight of her immortality, longing for a connection to a world she once knew. The more she plays, the more she becomes torn between her love for the virtual sun and the realization that she can never truly experience it again.",
        "Liam: Evelyn's human game guide and friend. He’s a young game developer with a keen interest in vampire folklore, which eventually leads him to uncover Evelyn's secret. As they bond over games, Liam feels a strong pull towards Evelyn, both out of fascination and empathy. While he enjoys the virtual world, he also understands its limitations and wants to help Evelyn find a deeper connection to the present real world. He’s torn between the wonder of having a real vampire friend and the responsibility he feels to help her find peace.",
        "Clarissa: An old friend and fellow vampire of Evelyn's. She disapproves of Evelyn's newfound obsession with video games, believing it's a distraction from their true nature and purpose. Clarissa struggles with her own acceptance of their fate but believes that they should embrace their nature rather than seeking solace in artificial worlds. As she watches Evelyn drift further into the virtual realm, Clarissa's concern grows, and she debates whether to intervene and pull Evelyn back to their dark reality or to let her find her own path."
