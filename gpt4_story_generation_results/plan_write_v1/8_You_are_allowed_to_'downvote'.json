    "setting": "In a world where disdain for politicians is the norm, democracies have evolved to allow citizens to 'downvote' government candidates, leading to most candidates ending with negative votes. Anonymity has become the golden key to winning, fostering a political landscape shrouded in shadows and secrecy. Cities and towns are filled with hidden alleys and secret meeting places where political discussions and campaigns are whispered. The air is dense with suspicion, as citizens are cautious about expressing their political views openly. Digital platforms are masked with layers of encryption, and the true identity of the candidates is a well-kept secret until the election day. The atmosphere is tense as election day approaches, with citizens curiously speculating about the anonymous figures running for office and contemplating whether to cast a vote or a downvote. The winner is often the most enigmatic, emerging from the shadows to lead a government tasked with healing the fractures of a divided society."
