    "setting": "The story unfolds in a quiet, small town surrounded by rolling hills and distant mountains, where everyone knows everyone. The protagonistâ€™s home, a modest and slightly worn-down two-story house, is filled with a mix of melancholy and warmth. The rooms inside are painted with faded colors, reflecting the emotional state of both the owner and the canine companion. The neighborhood is peaceful, with narrow tree-lined streets, small parks, and a scattering of essential businesses, including a veterinary clinic and a pet supply store. Mornings are usually foggy, and the air is filled with the chirping of birds, which adds a layer of normalcy to the life of the protagonist and their depressed service dog. The protagonist spends a lot of time in the local areas, walking the dog, and trying to find activities that might lift the spirit of their furry friend. As they venture through the town, they encounter other characters who contribute to their journey of mutual healing and discovery."
