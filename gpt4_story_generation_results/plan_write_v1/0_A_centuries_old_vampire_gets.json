    "setting": "The story is set in a gothic metropolis, bathed in eternal night, where modernity and ancient structures coexist. The city is divided between the human world and hidden vampire enclaves. Our vampire protagonist resides in a decrepit, cobweb-laden castle situated on the outskirts, shrouded in perpetual mist. In the human world, the city is alive with neon lights, bustling streets, and towering skyscrapers. The vampire, unable to experience the sun, retreats to a dimly lit, high-tech gaming room filled with monitors, consoles, and various gaming paraphernalia. Here, the vampire delves into the virtual world, exploring sunlit realms, vibrant landscapes, and bustling towns, experiencing daylight vicariously through the eyes of the video game characters."
