    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\ncoming-of-age, family\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Beneath the ornate chandelier in the vast dining room of the Greenwood estate, Eli sat, his posture imperfect and his face a contortion of frustration. Around him, the adult world buzzed—discussions of politics, weather, and economics. Yet his world, teetering on the cusp of adolescence, was entirely different.\n\nGrowing up in the mansion, he had always been the center of attention, the cherubic boy with golden locks. But at fourteen, the novelty was fading. His grandmother's fingers no longer pinched his cheeks; they now shook with age and wrapped around a cane.\n\nOne evening, while everyone else was engrossed in conversations far removed from his life, he noticed his sister, Clara, gazing at him from across the room. Her eyes bore a heaviness. Once, they'd been partners in mischief, but as the elder sibling, she had already crossed the treacherous bridge into adulthood. That night, when everyone retreated to their chambers, Clara pulled him aside.\n\nThe attic was filled with musty memories. Old letters, clothes, toys, and countless dusty trinkets that had seen better days. Clara opened an ancient looking album. The sepia-toned photos showed younger versions of their parents, laughing, dancing, and seemingly frozen in time.\n\n'Every generation faces its battles, Eli,' Clara whispered, brushing her fingers across the images. 'The transition from child to adult... it's not just about age. It’s an accumulation of experiences, feelings, and most importantly, choices.'\n\nEli's eyes fixed on a photo of their mother, a young girl, not much older than he was now. Her eyes held that same look of trepidation he felt every day. 'Did she...? Was she...?'\n\n'Lost? Scared? Yes.' Clara closed the album gently. 'But look at her now. Strong, resilient, the very pillar of this family. It’s a journey, Eli. And every choice, every stumble, it molds you.'\n\nTheir hands touched, bridging the chasm that had grown between them. In that musty attic, Eli realized that coming-of-age wasn’t just about growing older. It was about understanding, empathy, and connecting with the past to shape the future. It was about family—the root from which one sprang and the anchor that held them grounded.\n\nWith a newfound appreciation, he descended the stairs, feeling the weight of generations before him and yet, strangely, a little lighter in his own shoes."
