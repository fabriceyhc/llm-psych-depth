    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nloss\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Elaine sat in her old wooden chair, staring blankly at the empty chair opposite her. That chair had been Robert's. Their mornings began with the two of them sipping hot coffee, exchanging stories, and laughing about the trivialities of life. But now, with Robert gone, the room was an echo chamber of silence.\n\nIt wasn't the suddenness of Robert's death that hurt Elaine the most; it was the void he left behind. The thought of the countless mornings, afternoons, and nights she had to face without him was daunting. Their shared memories painted every corner of their home, yet its walls seemed alien now.\n\nAs she pondered, Elaine's fingers gently touched an old photograph on the table. A young Elaine and Robert, smiles beaming, standing on a beach. She remembered that day vividly—the scent of the ocean, the feeling of the sand between her toes, and most importantly, the warmth of Robert's hand in hers.\n\nA tear slid down Elaine's face. Not just of sorrow, but of gratitude. For she realized that every moment they had spent together was a gift. It wasn't about the quantity of the days but the quality. And in their short span together, they had lived a lifetime.\n\nElaine's neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, knocked softly on the door. Elaine wiped her tears and invited her in. The two women had been friends for years, but the recent events had deepened their bond.\n\n'I brought you some pie,' Mrs. Henderson said, placing the dish on the table. 'It's not much, but I thought it might bring some comfort.'\n\nElaine smiled weakly, 'Thank you, Clara. You always know how to make things a bit better.'\n\nAs they sat down, Clara spoke gently, 'Loss is painful, Elaine. But the pain is a testament to the love you shared. It's okay to grieve, but remember to also celebrate the life you two had.'\n\nElaine nodded, understanding the wisdom behind Clara's words. In the midst of her pain, she realized she was surrounded by love—from her memories with Robert, from her friends, and from the world around her. Loss was a part of life, but so was love, and she was determined to cherish both."
