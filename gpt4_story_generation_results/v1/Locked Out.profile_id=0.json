    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nmotherhood, teens, relationship\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Sarah, a mother in her late forties, stood outside her 17-year-old son Alex's room. The door, covered in posters of obscure bands and political slogans, was ajar. Soft music and intermittent typing were the only sounds permeating through.\n\nShe took a deep breath, remembering the days when she used to cradle him to sleep. How had time slipped so quickly, turning that cooing baby into this passionate, opinionated teenager? She recalled the countless nights they spent talking about everything and nothing. But lately, their conversations felt like navigating a minefield. They were short, curt, and invariably ended in silences or, worse, slamming doors.\n\nSarah gently knocked, breaking the rhythm of Alex's typing. \"Mind if I come in?\" she asked hesitantly.\n\nAlex looked up, surprised, \"Sure, Mom.\"\n\nSarah made her way inside, taking in the room she had been in countless times but somehow felt foreign now. She saw pictures of Alex's friends, his girlfriend Lisa, and amidst all the chaos, a small, slightly faded photograph of a younger Sarah holding baby Alex.\n\nShe pointed to the photo, \"Remember this day?\"\n\nAlex chuckled, \"Not really, I was a baby. But you've told me about it.\"\n\nSarah smiled, “That day, at the park, you cried until I got you that ice cream cone. But then you were too scared to eat it because of the bees. And somehow, all you wanted was for me to hold you.” She paused, trying to control the emotion in her voice. “I guess, sometimes, amidst all this growth, I miss my little boy.”\n\nAlex sighed, shifting uncomfortably. \"Mom, things change. I'm growing up.\"\n\nSarah nodded, “I know. And it terrifies me. The world out there isn’t always kind. I want to protect you, but I also need to trust you. Trust that I raised you right.”\n\nThey sat in silence, the weight of unsaid feelings pressing down. It was Alex who finally broke it, \"I get it, Mom. But you have to understand. I have my life, my friends, my relationship with Lisa. I need you to trust that I can handle it. That I can handle my emotions, my decisions.\"\n\nSarah held back tears, \"I do trust you, Alex. I just... I just miss us. Our relationship. We used to talk, laugh, share. Now, I feel like I'm losing you.\"\n\nAlex looked deep into his mother's eyes, seeing the fear, love, and longing. \"You're not losing me, Mom. Our relationship is just evolving, just like I am. We'll find our way.\"\n\nSarah smiled, wiping away a tear, \"Promise?\"\n\nAlex nodded, \"Promise.\"\n\nThe room, once filled with tension, now brimmed with hope. As mother and son sat side by side, the underlying threads of affection and understanding bound them tighter than ever."
