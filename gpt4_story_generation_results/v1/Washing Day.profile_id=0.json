    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nloss, grief\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "The room was filled with a heavy silence, the kind that seems to wrap itself around the room, suffocating every corner. Caroline sat on the edge of the bed, the last letter from her late husband clutched tightly in her hand. It had been a year since Michael's passing, but the weight of his absence pressed down on her heart as though it had happened yesterday.\n\nMichael's words flowed effortlessly on the paper. 'Dear Caroline, if you're reading this, it means I didn't make it back from my last trip. I want you to remember the love we shared, the laughter and tears. I hope you find solace in the memories we created together.' As she read the letter, images of their life together played in her mind. Their first date, their wedding, the birth of their son, and all the in-between moments that made their life special.\n\nTears streamed down her face, but they weren't just tears of grief. They were also tears of gratitude for the moments they shared, the love they had. It was a complex mixture of pain, love, loss, and remembrance.\n\nSarah, their 7-year-old daughter, walked into the room, her big blue eyes filled with curiosity. 'Mommy, why are you crying?' she asked. Caroline held out the letter, and Sarah slowly read it, her tiny voice faltering with emotion.\n\nThey sat together, wrapped in each other's arms, sharing the pain of Michael's loss. It was a bond they shared, an unspoken understanding that they were each other's anchor in the storm.\n\nWeeks turned into months, and while the sharp sting of Michael's absence dulled a bit, the void remained. Caroline tried her best to be strong for Sarah, to show her that even in the face of adversity, they could find strength and move forward. But there were days when the weight of grief was too much to bear.\n\nOne evening, while they were looking at old photographs, Sarah said, 'Mommy, I think Daddy is still with us. Not in person, but in spirit.' Caroline looked at her daughter, surprised by her wisdom. 'I think you're right,' she whispered, holding back tears.\n\nAs time passed, they found ways to honor Michael's memory. They started a foundation in his name, helping others who were dealing with loss and grief. It was their way of turning their pain into purpose.\n\nThe story of Caroline and Sarah is a testament to the power of love, the resilience of the human spirit, and the ability to find hope even in the darkest of times. It reminds us that even in the face of loss, life goes on, and we can find solace in the memories we hold dear."
