    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nmotherhood, parenting\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "The silent hallway echoed Nora's footfalls as she walked toward her daughter's room. At 35, she had lived half of her life cloaked in the identity of a mother, and yet, with every passing year, the fabric of that role had been stretched and torn, re-stitched, and refashioned.\n\nThe room was dim, with a soft blue light filtering through the curtains. Ella, at 15, lay curled up with a book, eyes welling up.\n\n'You okay, love?' Nora whispered, her heart aching as she imagined the turbulence that young hearts often navigate.\n\nElla looked up, her face a mosaic of adolescent uncertainty and fading childhood innocence. 'Mom, did you ever feel... lost when you were my age?'\n\nNora paused. The authenticity of the question demanded a genuine response. 'Every single day,' she confessed, sitting beside Ella. 'It was like being in a vast ocean, wanting to be found but also terrified of being seen.'\n\nElla blinked, absorbing the emotion in her mother's words. 'But how did you find your way?'\n\nNora smiled, her eyes distant. 'I didn't, not right away. But with every storm, every mistake, I learnt. I held onto the tiny moments of joy, the fleeting instances of clarity. And you, my love, were my North Star.'\n\nThe two sat there, bound not just by blood but by the shared journey of womanhood. Nora, in her motherhood, had discovered the depth of her strength and the fragility of her spirit. In Ella, she saw her younger self—navigating the choppy waters of teenage years, seeking identity and acceptance.\n\nAs hours passed, they delved into tales of Nora's youth, uncovering layers of emotions—some bitter, some sweet. They laughed at teenage blunders and cried at lessons painfully learned.\n\nIt was a shared catharsis, a realization that while the tapestry of life is woven with threads of joy, pain, love, and loss, it is the act of sharing, understanding, and empathizing that adds color and richness.\n\nElla, drawn into her mother's tales, saw her not just as a caregiver but as a woman who once was as lost as she felt now. Nora, on the other hand, was reminded of the responsibility and privilege of guiding her daughter through the labyrinth of life, with all its twists and turns.\n\nThe room, once just a space, transformed into a sanctuary where two souls connected and rediscovered each other. The complexities of their relationship, the shifts in dynamics from protector to confidante, from guide to friend, all converged in that one night.\n\nAs dawn approached, Nora kissed Ella's forehead, a silent promise that while the journey ahead might be challenging, they would navigate it together, as companions, each learning from the other.\n\nAnd as Nora stepped out, she realized that motherhood was not just about parenting but also about mutual growth, understanding, and the unbreakable bond forged in the crucible of shared experiences."
