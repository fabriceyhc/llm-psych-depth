    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\ncrime, motherhood\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "The air was thick with tension. Marie had long realized that her son, Alex, was not like other children. He had a proclivity for mischief which, over time, escalated into full-blown criminal activities. She'd find stolen trinkets under his bed or hear whispered tales from neighbors about her son’s escapades.\n\nBut tonight was different. Marie sat on her worn-out couch, hands trembling. Laid out before her were stolen valuables, none of which Alex had tried to hide. As the neon lights from outside painted the room in hues of blue and red, tears streaked down her face. How had her love not been enough to set him straight?\n\nEvery stolen item told a tale. The cracked watch, whose hands were forever frozen at 2:17, belonged to an old man down the lane. Marie remembered him teaching Alex how to tell time. And then, there was the diamond necklace from Mrs. Johnson, who had once cradled Alex as a baby. She could hear Mrs. Johnson's lullabies echoing faintly, drowned out by the sound of approaching sirens.\n\nWhen Alex burst through the door, he found his mother weeping amidst his stolen treasures. Their eyes met, and for the first time in years, Marie saw vulnerability in her son’s eyes. She realized that, to him, every stolen item was not just an act of rebellion but a cry for her attention.\n\nWith every ounce of strength, Marie stood up, walked towards Alex, and enveloped him in a hug. Alex's defenses broke as tears cascaded down both their faces. She whispered, 'We will face this together.' It was a promise not just of motherhood, but of unconditional love.\n\nThe wailing sirens grew louder, but in that brief moment, both mother and son felt a connection deeper than any crime could sever."
