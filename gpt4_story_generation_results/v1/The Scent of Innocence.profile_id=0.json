Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nloss\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Ellen stood at the edge of the shore, where foamy waves caressed the sand and retreated back, almost mirroring her own hesitations. The cold ocean wind ruffled her hair and carried with it the scent of salt and memories. The pendant around her neck, a heart-shaped locket, felt cold against her skin. Inside, it held a small, black-and-white photograph of a little boy with twinkling eyes and a mischievous grin.\n\nShe remembered the day the picture was taken. It was a sunlit afternoon in their backyard, and young Danny had just stolen a cookie from the kitchen, his face smeared with chocolate. 'Caught you!' she had laughed, snapping the picture. That was two years ago. Now, the backyard lay silent, and the kitchen was devoid of stolen treats and giggles.\n\nEllen had always believed in the simplicity of emotions, categorizing them into happiness, sadness, anger, and love. Yet, standing there, she felt a tumultuous wave of emotions she couldn't name. There was an aching longing for days gone by, a deep-seated guilt for the accident she couldn't prevent, and a burning anger at the universe for taking her boy away. Her internal turmoil was so authentic, so raw, that the lines between past and present blurred. The emotions weren't just hers. They were universalâ€”the anguish of every mother who had ever lost a child.\n\nA stranger approached, his face etched with lines of age and experience. 'It never truly goes away, you know?' he said softly, glancing at the locket. 'The pain. But it does change. It evolves into something you can live with. And you find reasons to smile again.' Ellen looked into his eyes, searching for understanding and finding an ocean of shared pain. In that brief interaction, without a backstory, there was a deep connection, a shared humanity.\n\nShe nodded slowly. 'I hope so,' she whispered, clutching the locket tighter. As the man walked away, she realized that loss wasn't just an event but a journey. A journey filled with complex layers of emotion, introspection, and growth. It wasn't linear but a web, connecting past memories, present pain, and hopes for a future. As the sun set, painting the sky with hues of red and orange, Ellen felt a tiny glimmer of hope that someday, she might find her way back to laughter, to joy, and to acceptance."
