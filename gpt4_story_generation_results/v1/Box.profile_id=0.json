If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nlife, growth, facade\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Ella stood still, facing the old oak tree. Its gnarled branches reached out like arms, each one telling tales of time. Beneath the tree's shade, she recalled her childhood, the games played, and secrets whispered. She'd spent years away from this town, evolving, adapting, and sometimes, hiding. Ella had learned early on that to survive in the outside world, facades were essential. The young, naive girl she was had to be buried beneath layers of masks.\n\nAs the sunlight dappled through the leaves, memories of growth and change raced through her mind. There were times she wore the mask of a diligent student, impressing professors with her sharp wit. Yet, nights saw her shedding tears, wondering if she had traded authenticity for accolades. Later, as an artist in a city that slept little, Ella sported the mask of a bohemian spirit. Her art depicted emotions – raw, intense, unfiltered. But off the canvas, she stifled her true feelings, fearing they'd shatter her crafted image.\n\nIn the midst of her introspection, a gentle hand rested on her shoulder. It was Martha, her childhood friend. The two had taken different paths, with Martha choosing to stay, nurturing her roots while Ella sought growth elsewhere. Their eyes met, a complex tapestry of memories interwoven with the passage of time. No words were spoken, yet the emotions were palpable - joy, regret, nostalgia.\n\nMartha's eyes seemed to ask, 'Who are you now, Ella?' And Ella, for the first time in years, didn't have an answer. All she felt was a void where her authentic self should have been. The facade had become her reality.\n\nElla sighed, 'I've lost myself, Martha.'\n\nMartha squeezed her hand. 'It's never too late to find your way back.'\n\nA tear slid down Ella's cheek, the weight of her masks feeling heavier than ever. Yet, amidst the pain was a blossoming hope. She realized that the façade wasn’t a permanent structure but a mere layer that could be peeled off.\n\nThis oak tree had witnessed Ella's life and growth. Beneath its vast expanse, she decided to embark on the most challenging journey yet – unmasking herself, rediscovering her essence. She didn't have all the answers, but she had a starting point and an old friend to guide her.\n\nThe tree, with its timeless wisdom, seemed to whisper, 'Life is not about the facades you build, but the growth you embrace and the truths you unearth.'"
