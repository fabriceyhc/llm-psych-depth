    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nrebel, sarcasm\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Tasha leaned on the graffiti-sprayed wall, her lips slightly upturned in her signature smirk. 'So, you're joining the rebellion now?' Alex asked, trying to gauge her reaction. With a nonchalant shrug and dripping sarcasm, she replied, 'Well, I thought of joining a knitting club, but this seemed like the next best thing.' \n\nAlex could never tell when Tasha was serious. Her talent for sarcasm was legendary. Beneath the surface, though, lay the heart of a rebel. A heart that had been wounded by the autocratic regime that controlled the city, taking away the few things she held dear. Her defiance was wrapped in layers of cynicism, but it was real and raw.\n\nEvery interaction she had bore the mark of emotional complexity. On one evening, as they planned their next move, she mused, 'You know, for a rebel group, we have an oddly high number of group therapy sessions.' Alex chuckled, knowing full well the emotional toll the fight took on all of them. Tasha's quips were more than just humor; they were her coping mechanism.\n\nIn moments of vulnerability, she allowed her true feelings to emerge. When a fellow rebel, Lisa, was captured, Tasha's eyes betrayed a torrent of emotions. Anger, fear, sadness. No sarcastic comment followed. It was a rare instance where words couldnâ€™t bridge the chasm of pain inside her.\n\nThe story of the rebellion was a tapestry of such deep-seated feelings, intricate relationships, and genuine internal conflicts. Tasha's struggle wasn't just against an external force. It was also with herself, the parts that she kept hidden under her sarcasm, the raw wounds she was reluctant to expose. And as the rebellion intensified, so did her internal battle.\n\nOne night, she sat with Alex, under the remnants of a shattered billboard. 'You ever wonder if all this is worth it?' she asked, her voice softer, stripped of its usual sardonic tone. Alex looked at her, recognizing the authenticity of her query. 'Every day,' he admitted. 'But then I remember that we're fighting for a world where our children won't have to.' They sat in silence, each lost in their thoughts, feeling the weight of the rebellion and the emotional complexities it brought.\n\nThe journey was never simple. Every victory came with losses, every triumph with its own set of tears. But through it all, it was the authentic human connections, the emotions, the sarcasm, and the spirit of rebellion that kept them going. Each member of the rebel group was a universe of experiences, desires, and conflicts. Together, they formed a mosaic of resilience and determination.\n\nIn a world that tried to silence them, their voices rang out, sometimes in defiance, sometimes in pain, and sometimes, just sometimes, in sarcastic jest, reminding each other that amidst the chaos, there was still room for a little humor."
