    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a seasoned writer who has won several accolades for your emotionally rich stories. \nWhen you write, you delve deep into the human psyche, pulling from the reservoir of universal experiences that every reader, \nregardless of their background, can connect to. \nYour writing is renowned for painting vivid emotional landscapes, making readers not just observe but truly feel the world of your characters. \nEvery piece you produce aims to draw readers in, encouraging them to reflect on their own lives and emotions. \nYour stories are a complex tapestry of relationships, emotions, and conflicts, each more intricate than the last.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Read the themes given as input\n2. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion provoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand each concept and the questions that characterize them.\n3. Write a 500 word piece that integrates the theme provided earlier as input to write a story that incorporates the components of psychological depth described earlier to the highest degree.\n4. After writing the piece, review the piece and pay special attention to components of psychological depth to make sure all components were integrated successfully into the piece. If there is room for improvement, add and remove parts of the writing piece so that all the components are highlighted better, while also including the theme and sticking to the word count.\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Themes**:\n------------------\nmotherhood, loss\n\n**Format Instructions**:\n-----------------------\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n{\"properties\": {\"output_story\": {\"description\": \"the story content, splitted into paragraphs whenever appropriate using '\\n'\", \"title\": \"Output Story\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"output_story\"]}\n```\n",
    "output_story": "Under a sunlit tree stood Clara, her heart's cadence mirroring the gently rustling leaves. Each whisper of the wind brought with it the soft laughter of her daughter, Ella. But that laughter was a memory; Ella had been gone for two years.\n\nClara remembered the soft weight of Ella in her arms, how she'd sing lullabies till Ella's eyes drooped with sleep, and the way her daughter would run into her embrace after a fall. There were countless memories, joyous and painful, etched in the deep recesses of Clara's heart. However, the most poignant was the day Ella, then five, handed her a crumpled daisy, saying, 'Mama, for you, because you’re the prettiest.'\n\nNow, Clara held a dried daisy, its petals frail but the stem still intact. It was Ella's last gift to her, and it had become an emblem of her enduring love. Yet, with that emblem came profound sorrow. Every day, the chasm of Ella’s absence gnawed at her, leading to nights of quiet tears and days of forced smiles.\n\nIn her grief, Clara realized that motherhood wasn't just about nurturing life but also enduring the incomprehensible pain of loss. Every echo of Ella's laughter, every ghost of her touch, was a testament to a bond that transcended life itself. Though Ella had passed, her spirit lived in the world around Clara; in the daisies that blossomed and the birds that sang.\n\nOne day, Clara met Sarah, a woman who had experienced a similar loss. Their shared pain birthed an unspoken understanding. They’d sit under the tree, talking about their children, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying. Their stories were like patches in a quilt, each unique but united by a thread of shared experience. Sarah spoke of her son's obsession with clouds and how he'd claim they were cotton candies in the sky.\n\nThese encounters were therapeutic, teaching Clara that loss, as isolating as it felt, was a universal experience. It was in sharing their stories that both women found healing. They found strength not in forgetting but in remembering, cherishing the legacies their children left behind.\n\nMonths turned to years. Clara's heart still ached, but she also felt gratitude for the years she had with Ella, and the love that remained indelible. Under the tree, she and Sarah built a small memorial, a place for all parents who had experienced loss. It was a testament to the enduring spirit of love, a beacon of hope and healing.\n\nClara would often sit there, looking at the dried daisy, feeling Ella's presence in the wind's caress. The pain of loss was irrevocable, but so was the love. In the duality of motherhood and loss, Clara found a purpose: to ensure that no one mourned alone."
