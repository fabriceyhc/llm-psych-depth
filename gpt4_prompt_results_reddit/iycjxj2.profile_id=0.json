Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nIf anyone had asked me what horror was, up to half a minute ago I would have definitely answered something on the lines of \"demons\" or \"zombie apocalypse\".\n\nBut nothing could have prepared me for the shock of seeing two identical faces, two indistinguishable beings staring back at me from the yellowed photograph that fell out of my wife's sister memorial.\n\nThe more I stare at the picture, though, the more subtle differences I notice.
