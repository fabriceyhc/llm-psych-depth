Whether it's a business deal or after a good fight, it's a sign of respect!\". His chest would always swell with pride at those words. Your throat tightens for a moment from the memory, a dampness, not wholly attributed to sleep, around your eyes.\n\nBut now is not the time, you remind yourself. You can miss your father later. Now, you must focus on the handshake. Its grip is strong, so you match it in strength and add just a little more. A man of noble standing, judging by his form.\n\nAs you shake it, it feels strange. Like a hand, to be sure, but not quite right. You focus on the sensation. Leather, smooth and cool, quite supple too. Definitely gloved. A man of some wealth, judging by the quality.\n\nSuddenly, you realise why it feels strange. You count the fingers. Surely not. You count again. Yes, six. Definitely six. In the darkness, you reach under the pillow for your sword, an unseen smile creeping across your lips.\n\nYou decide to break the silence. \"Hello\" you say. \"My name is Inigo Montoya...\"",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nYou're still groggy from being woken, but you remember your father's advice. \"Son,\" he used to say, \"a firm handshake makes a good first impression.
