    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nAmeth-ta had ten thousand eyes, and every last one of them was weeping.

    "authentic_explanation": "The story explores a cosmic setting that inherently departs from 'real human experiences.' The representation of the psychological processes of the deities in the text does not parallel human emotions in a strictly realistic sense, but the portrayal of grief, vengeance, and disbelief brings an element of relatability.",
    "authentic_score": 2,
    
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The portrayal of deities grieving over the loss of one of their own and the twist of vengeance by the humans creates a strong emotional pull. The demise of multiple deities provides moments of shock and emotion. The expressions of anger, disbelief, and grief further enhance this dimension.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 4,
    
    "empathy_explanation": "While readers may not directly empathize with interstellar deities, the emotions they display—grief, anger, and betrayal—are universally recognizable. This allows for a certain level of introspection, even if the setting and characters are far removed from human experience.",
    "empathy_score": 3,
    
    "engagement_explanation": "The unfolding narrative, with its stakes and the surprise turn of events, creates a compelling pull. The initial portrayal of a funeral setting immediately generates curiosity, and as the narrative progresses, the dramatic events maintain reader engagement.",
    "engagement_score": 4,
    
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The story possesses multifaceted personalities for the deities, beyond mere caricatures of cosmic entities. The intricate dynamics of the deities' reactions to human actions, the complex emotions experienced due to the loss of their 'soul-planets,' and the portrayal of the humans' drastic measures lend narrative depth. However, the exploration of relationships between characters could have been further deepened.",
