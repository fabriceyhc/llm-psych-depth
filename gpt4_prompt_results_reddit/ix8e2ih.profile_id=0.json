You can call me Jim though if it's easier. My last name's Zupp.\"\n\nShe flipped to the end of the report. \"Wow, okay. Yeah, I do see you. You only received a single downvote. It looks like your name actually ended up printed on the back of the ballot by itself.\"\n\n\"That was me. Thought it was only fair if I voted for myself.\"\n\n\"Do you even understand how the new ballot system works? You vote for the people you don't want in office.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Zjim straightened his ill-fitting tie. He hadn't worn one since fourth grade when he was 4-H treasurer. It was a little small now. \"I don't want in office. My mom said I could only keep living with her if I was actively applying to jobs, so I figured running for president, you know, that's a job. I didn't do any campaigning or anything, either.\"\n\nThe woman's sighed, and pulled back the curtain to reveal the crowd of people gathered at the square.

I'm glad I managed to not upset any of you yet.\"\n\nZjim wandered back behind the curtain.\n\n\"Who the hell was that?\" From the otherwise mute crowd. Several laughs followed, breaking into chittering discussion.\n\n\"That's it?\" The woman asked. It was the question that would be asked many more times through President Zupp's term.\n\nThe man that would go on to lead the Free world into an era of peace, prosperity, and nationwide economic coziness shrugged. \"Where's the bathroom in this place?\"",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\n\"Zjim.\" Zjim offered, stepping up to the stage.\n\n\"Jim?
