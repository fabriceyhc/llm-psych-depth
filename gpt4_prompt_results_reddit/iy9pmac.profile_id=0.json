He\u2019d been working on it for more than two years, while I paid the bills, and when he\u2019d sent it away to a big publisher, the arrival of a massive, \u00a350,000 advance cheque had been amazing.\n\nBill had done most of the work, but I\u2019d done my bit: it was one of our rituals to read a few pages together, every Sunday afternoon and discuss the character, plot, and future developments. Bill preferred it that way. I left him alone for the rest of the week as he said he could concentrate better that way. In a little office he rented. No distraction.\n\nI\u2019d been looking forward to getting my hands on the first copy and I\u2019d been queuing since 8 a.m., waiting for the shop to open. Bill was going to be so surprised when he got home tonight. I have to say, I was very surprised that the publisher didn\u2019t give him an advance copy , if only to proof read it, but what do I know about publishing? Maybe they do it all by email these days? Well they\u2019re paying, so I guess they get to call the shots.\n\nThere\u2019d been a big publicity campaign, telling people how good the novel is. Transformational, one called it. Bill\u2019s been giving interviews and telling people how it\u2019s all based on his own life experiences. There\u2019s been so much hype that the queue to buy it snaked round the block. I\u2019m so proud\u2026\n\nMy heart skipped a beat as the bookshop staff unlocked the door and the crowd surged forward, which caught me by surprise. They\u2019re so keen! Still, I\u2019d made sure I was near the head of the queue. I had to get a copy today! Bill\u2019s first published novel!\n\nAt twenty quid, it wasn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s all money in Bill\u2019s pocket, and from the way the crowd were buying the copies, they would be sold out soon!\n\nI hugged my precious copy to my chest and made my way to the checkout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s brilliant!!\u201d The cashier was bubbling with enthusiasm. \u201cBest erotic fantasy since Fifty Shades! Better, even!\u201d\n\n\u201cErotic fantasy? But I thought it was a mystery novel\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no. It\u2019s about a bored husband who manages to sleep with every woman under the age of 70 in his entire street! He tells his wife he\u2019s writing a novel, but sets up a shag-pad and gets to it\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t need an imagination to know what \u201cit\u201d was.\n\nI put the book back on the shelf. No point in letting Bill know that I knew. I dare say I\u2019ll be able to pick up a copy in a few months as evidence in the divorce courts. I can wait.

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nI have to admit, seeing my partner\u2019s novel in colourful, glossy piles in the windows of the biggest bookshop in the city felt good.
