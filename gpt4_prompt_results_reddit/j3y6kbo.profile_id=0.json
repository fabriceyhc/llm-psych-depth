My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.\n\n\"Molly.\" I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.\n\n\"Molly!\" I yell this time.\n\n\"Hello.\" I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. \"I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother.\"\n\n\"I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?\" I ask, trying to control my own voice.\n\n\"I am the night.\"\n\"Where's Molly?\" I say again.\n\n\"I said, I am the night!\" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. \"I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves.\"\n\nI roll my eyes. \"Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!\"\n\n\"She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side.\"\n\nI stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.\n\n\"Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant.\" I yell.\n\n\"I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . .\"\nI cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.\n\n\"She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job.\"\n\n\"College?\" The moon goddess pauses. \"College?\" She croaks.\n\n\"Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history.\" Please not art history, I think.\n\n\"Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?\" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.\n\nI shake my head. \"NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way.\"\n\n\"She doesn't know how to fight evil?\" The moon goddess asks.\n\n\"NO!\" I scream. \"Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!\"\n\nI take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink.\n\n\"Her hair!\" I yell into the locket.\n\n\"Sorry.\" The moon goddess is gone. The lights go out and I take one step back to turn the lamp on.",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nI open the locket, slowly and a beam of pink light shines out, filling the room.
