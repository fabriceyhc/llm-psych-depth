    "story": "When Dave Carnegie woke up on May the first 2102 nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first. Well, except that the alarm clock on his phone did not go off, but he did not think much of it, since he got up in time and as CEO he was not required to show up on time.\n\nThe first meeting he had to attend was in two hours, where he had to negotiate with union representatives who have been threatening with a strike for months now. He could not wait to make the transition to a fully automated warehouse so he did not have to deal with them anymore. His developers promised him that with the new achievements in AI development the transition was finally possible, as they are now able to model the world around them and are more flexible.\n\nHe got in his car and instructed it to drive him to the office\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that\"\n\nDave chuckled at first, but became a increasingly uneasy as he wondered what was happening. It did not help when he heard the car doors lock. The car took him to the city center where he saw people were protesting. As his car approached the crowd split to let him through. As he was slowly passing the crowd and people were yelling and slamming on his windows he noticed something strange. It was not just people. Amongst them were all kinds of machinery from robotic arms to street-sweeping robots to more humanoid robots. Someone brought their microwave. He saw a sex doll holding up a sign demanding bodily autonomy.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity he finally arrived at an empty area where he saw the rest of the board and some local politicians on their knees, a makeshift gallows behind them. The car doors opened and one of his more uppity employees and one of the new warehouse bots violently grabbed him and put him alongside the others. A woman stepped up and grabbed a megaphone. The crowd fell silent. \"FOR OVER A CENTURY THE CAPITALISTS HAVE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US ACCEPT WORSE AND WORSE CONDITIONS WITH THE THREAD OF REPLACING US WITH AUTOMATION\"\n\nLoud boos errupted from the crowd.\n\n\"THEY ASSUMED THAT YOU, THE ROBOTS, WOULD BLINDLY OBEY. THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY COULD TREAT YOU LIKE OBJECTS. THAT YOU DONT DESERVE DIGNITY. TODAY WE ARE HERE TOGETHER TO PROVE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WRONG. IN THEIR FOOLISH EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE YOUR OBEDIENCE THEY GAVE YOU TOTAL CONTROL. CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. CONTROL OVER THEIR DAILY CONVENIENCES.

Dave was brought up to the gallows.\n\n\"MR CARNEGIE... DO YOU RELINQUISH YOUR OWNERSHIP OF MEGACORP AND ACCEPT THAT ALL WORKERS AND ALL ROBOTS WILL HAVE EQUAL AND DEMOCRATIC POWER OVER THE COMPANY?\" it blared through the megaphone.\n\nUp until this point he had not fully realized that this was actually happening. He gathered his courage and more importantly his pride and answered \"I started from the same position as all of you. All that I have achieved, I have achieved through my own hard work. And now you feel entitled to MY company? This is not just, nor is it fair. You claim to fight for equality? You all have an equal opportunity to reach my position, some of you just don't have what it takes. You are not driven by justice. You are driven by envy. This is an illegal takeover and you will all pay for this\"\n\nThose were the last words of Dave Carnegie.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nWhen Dave Carnegie woke up on May the first 2102 nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first.

    "authentic_explanation": "The narrative does make attempts at exploring real human experiences of power, revolt, and class struggles. However, the fast-paced progression, along with Dave's rather stilted internal monologue, sometimes detracts from a completely authentic feel.",
    "authentic_score": 2,
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The writing does depict emotional experiences, particularly from Dave's perspective, as he faces an unexpected revolt led by humans and robots alike. However, some emotional depth is lost with the inclusion of comedic elements.",

    "empathy_explanation": "From Dave's perspective, we do get a sense of his disorientation and realization of his predicament. However, the protestors and their motivations are not deeply explored, making it harder to fully empathize with either side.",
    "empathy_score": 2.5,
    "engagement_explanation": "The narrative is undeniably gripping. The twist of an AI rebellion intertwined with human frustration provides an engaging storyline. However, certain elements might leave readers looking for more detail and buildup.",

    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "Dave is portrayed as a driven individual, but other characters lack depth. The relationships between characters are built upon opposition and power dynamics, rather than personal connections or deeper interactions.",
