That no one would find out?\" I yelled. \"That I am so easily appeased and illiterate that I wouldn't buy my own fiance's book?\"\n\nHe sighed, ashamed. \"I... didn't think it would matter.\"\n\nI scoffed. \"You didn't think it would matter that you tore me shreds in your book?\"\n\n\"I changed the names!\" he desperately reminded me. \"It's not like anyone knows that it's you!\"\n\n\"EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S ME!\" I roared. \"WHO ELSE IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE?!\"\n\nI'd picked up a copy of the book yesterday, practically giddy when I saw it displayed front and center at our favorite bookstore.

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nHe pleaded with me as I packed my suitcase. \"It's doesn't mean anything.
