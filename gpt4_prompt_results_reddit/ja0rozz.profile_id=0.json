He spoke firmly and confidently into the dark of his bedroom, hand clasped tightly around\u2026something, just under his bed frame. \u201cI can\u2019t very well look you in the eyes if I can\u2019t see you, friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a man,\u201d said a quiet voice, muffled behind the bedskirt. \u201cNot a friend,\u201d it said louder.\n\nTyler tightened his grasp. \u201cThat\u2019s my fault, friend,\u201d said Tyler, ever cool in awkward social settings. \u201cI should not have misgendered you. You see, my father was old school, and I should probably modify his sayings for the modern age.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a friend,\u201d said the voice again.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to break it to you, friend,\u201d said Tyler jovially, \u201cbut where I come from\u2014which just so happens to be here\u2014a handshake that lasts this long is called holding hands. And if we ain\u2019t friends holding hands, then we must be lovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovers?\u201d Said the voice noticeably caught off guard.\n\nTyler\u2019s father had taught him many things in life. The handshake thing, sure. Something about never trusting a fart after Tijuana Tuesday\u2014another truism Tyler would need to modernize. But one of the most important things Tyler\u2019s father had taught him was this:\n\nIf you\u2019re caught in a bad situation, always be the craziest one in the room\u2014no one wants to mess with crazy.\n\n\u201cYou heard right,\u201d said Tyler quietly. \u201cWe must be lovers. You\u2019re already in my bedroom, you\u2019re holding my hand, what\u2019s next, my sweet underbed lurker? What will we do with all this pent up\u2026energy?\u201d Tyler extended his index finger and began to lightly stroke whatever it was that he was holding.\n\nTyler heard muffled grunts as the being struggled to release itself from his grip. \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d Shouted the voice. \u201cDude, what the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d\n\nTyler held strong. \u201cDude? What a cute pet name for me. I think I\u2019ll call you honey!\u201d Tyler crooned. \u201cCome on up, honey! Let\u2019s see what kind of trouble we can get into.\u201d\n\nTyler felt the being below him thrash about under his bed, it\u2019s body slammed against the underside of his box spring and rang loudly throughout the quiet house. \u201cSeriously, dude. Let me go!\u201d Said the voice. \u201cI promise, I\u2019ll leave, just let me go.\u201d The voice sounded scared. Desperate.\n\nNow it was Tyler\u2019s chance to put to practice another of his father\u2019s wise words:\n\nIf you ain\u2019t gonna eat it, let it go quick.\n\n\u201cI always was more of a catch and release fisherman,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cYou be good now, though. I don\u2019t want to hear about you holding hands with other lovers around town, honey. I\u2019m a jealous man,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nHe loosened his grip and let go. Tyler heard the sound of claws against his hardwood floor as whatever it was scurried away as fast as it could.\n\nTyler fell quickly back to sleep, unfazed by his impromptu midnight hand holding session.\n\nShortly after falling back to sleep he felt a pressure on his chest. He opened his eyes to see his sleep paralysis demon staring back at him.\n\n\u201cHey there good-lookin,\u201d he said cheerfully.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018good-lookin\u2019 me!\u201d Said the Demon. \u201cWhat the fuck was all that \u2018honey\u2019 shit earlier? You thought I wouldn\u2019t see that?\u201d\n\nTyler exhaled loudly. Another truism of his father\u2019s:\n\nTry as you might, you can\u2019t out crazy crazy.",
