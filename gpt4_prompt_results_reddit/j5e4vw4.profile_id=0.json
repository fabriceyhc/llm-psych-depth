    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1.

Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nAs you can see, the bee in front of me buzzed in morse code, the Queen believes that our professional relationship can now move to the next level.\n\nI took a sip of my honey-chamomille tea. \"Do go on,\" I replied calmly.\n\nWe have observed the transactions with the rent you remove from our hive.\n\n\"The honey,\" I corrected.\n\nYes.

    "authentic_explanation": "The story presents a fantastical premise wherein bees communicate with a human via Morse code. While the premise is highly imaginative and not immediately true to real human experiences, the emotions and interactions between the human and the bees are depicted in an authentic manner. For instance, the negotiation over the hive's conditions and the mutual benefits mirrors real-world business dealings. Yet, some suspension of disbelief is necessary.",
    "authentic_score": 2,
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The story touches on the unexpected surprise, humor, and cooperation between species. While it brings smiles with phrases like \"hostile takeover\" and the bee's lack of understanding of \"writing,\" it does not deeply delve into the emotional intricacies. The story does evoke amusement, but it doesn't necessarily stir intense emotions in the reader.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 2.5,
    "empathy_explanation": "It's easy to find the human character relatable, as they try to negotiate and find common ground with a bee. The curiosity and adaptability of the bees also make them endearing. However, due to the story's brevity and lightheartedness, the reader isn't led into profound introspection or new insights about oneself or the world.",
    "empathy_score": 3,
    "engagement_explanation": "The story's unique premise and the playful tone engage the reader's interest from the start. The dialogue and quick pacing ensure that readers want to know how the conversation will conclude. It's engaging in its whimsicality and fresh perspective.",
    "engagement_score": 4,
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "Characters in this short tale, while charming, are not extensively developed beyond their immediate roles. There's the bee, representing the hive's interests, and the human, being considerate yet practical. Relationships are straightforward, and while there's a clear conflict and resolution regarding the hive's expansion, deeper character relationships and internal conflicts aren't present.",
