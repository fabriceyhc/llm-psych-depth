At least you wish that would happen.\u201d\n\nI gave the old dog a pat on the back, taking a spot next to him on the couch. His brown eyes only focused on the driveway outside, not even looking away when a brightly colored bird fluttered past, not letting anything break his focus. I never thought a dog of all things could look miserable, but there was no tail wagging or tongue poking out. It was just a lonely stare, one filled with a deep hurt that can only be felt when you\u2019ve truly lost something special.\n\n\u201cShe must have been a hell of an owner. Probably snuck you little treats, right?\u201d I put on a smile, trying to get his attention. Didn\u2019t dogs usually respond to trigger words like treats or walkies? Still, not even the allure of a possible treat turned their attention away. I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my wit\u2019s end on how to help him. It wasn\u2019t fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.\n\nPerhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasn\u2019t anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yet\u2026 I couldn\u2019t convince myself of that.\n\nI knew sadness. It\u2019s been something that\u2019s suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was me. What is it about depression that makes you want to free others of it while leaving yourself to drown in its murky waters? Why do I care about getting up in the morning for his sake when I was happy to rot away in bed when I was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to visit one.\n\n\u201cI lost a special woman, too. Sometimes I wake up thinking she\u2019s still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? That\u2019s when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re going crazy, right?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words weren\u2019t entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadn\u2019t faced me. It was the most he had given me so far.\n\nWould I have taken him in if I knew his owner had passed so recently? I don\u2019t know, the entire process still feels like a blur. A few doctors\u2019 appointments and signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. I\u2019m sure that there was more to that process, but I couldn\u2019t really remember the details of it. Still, even if not intentionally, the dog had given me a reason to get up in the morning. So, I\u2019m sure the people that assigned him would say it\u2019s working as intended.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make some tea. Want anything?\u201d I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldn\u2019t respond felt fulfilling on some level.\n\nI gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always, the kitchen was a mess. Dirty plates were still set at the table, carefully moved so I could eat around them. Not to mention the bowl of fruit that had to be at least three weeks old at this point. I just ignored the smell, pushing aside the plastic bags on my counter as I took a tea bag. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.\n\nI placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his side. I took a sip and joined him, staring at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people weren\u2019t in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sun\u2019s still shining.\u201d Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldn\u2019t convince myself I wanted to deal with that. But it wasn\u2019t for me, was it? \u201cWe could take a walk. Just around the block. Maybe about ten minutes or so, nothing major.\u201d My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.\n\nI slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldn\u2019t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. My motivation was ruined after that thought crossed my mind. What good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.\n\nWhen I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but I\u2019ll be here for you, ok?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.\n\n\u201cEven if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?\u201d Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds don\u2019t develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.\n\n\u201cAnyway, a quick walk, then we can lounge around. Five minutes!\u201d I pushed myself from the couch and brought over his lead. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go get some sun.\u201d",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\n\u201cStill looking, huh?
