No one asked the right questions. So here we are working 4-hour workdays based on the Vretal definition of hours. Works out to about 20 Terran hours. And the Vretal use a five-day work week.\n\nThe Vretal provide work for all people. No choice allowed. You show up at the work center and get assigned to a random work site. You could spend your \"4-hour shift\" picking up shit at one of the Vretal zoos or in a warehouse moving dangerous chemicals without safety gear. Or you could get selected for a stint as a \"decorative object\" or as a medical research subject. The Vretal don't take \"no\" for an answer. Work or die.\n\nIf you get hurt, then the Vretal pop you into one of the \"universal med units\". It mostly works to put you back together. Mostly. Just ignore the occasional uneven arms and missing fingers. Don't ask why you may have a differently colored eye. The Vretal stuck every single person with physical or mental problems into one. You don't want to know what med unit does to the human brain when it \"fixes' brain damage or mental issues. If the med unit can't fix you, it doesn't spit you back out. A future user could end up with a new tattoo.\n\nThe Vretal provided housing for all. A nice, bare bones tube unit. Just big enough for one. No frills, no entertainment, no choice. You don't even get to keep the same unit. It's assigned after you complete the day's shift. You have to use it. Those that sleep outside often disappear.\n\nEveryone gets feed. A nice serving of processed glop. Mostly meets all the nutritional needs for the average human. Once a day. No one is sure what's in it. After a while, you stop asking. The Vretal don't care if you try to grow your own food so long as you complete your \"4-hour\" shift first. Good luck finding a place to grow food. The Vretal cleared the farmlands for their food, and they guard them zealously.\n\nAs the Vretal said, \"Humans now belong to the Vretal Empire\".

    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nThose idiots.
