    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nIt was the worst decision we had ever made as a species.\n\nManufacturing consent wasn't even that hard in the old world.

    "authentic_explanation": "The depiction of power dynamics and the influence of media and money on societal structures is a relevant reflection of real-world concerns. However, the story leans heavily into dystopian clichés and overgeneralizations without much nuanced exploration. As such, the portrayal feels somewhat superficial and lacks the depth to convey a wholly authentic human experience.",
    "authentic_score": 2.5,
  
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The writing paints a bleak picture of a society under the thumb of shadowy power-brokers. While it hints at the emotional toll of such a world, it doesn't delve deep into the individual emotional experiences or show a wide variety of emotions. It predominantly stirs feelings of disillusionment and frustration but doesn't effectively make space for other emotions.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 3,
  
    "empathy_explanation": "The story describes a societal structure, but doesn't introduce us to individual characters or personal stories. Without personal narratives, it's challenging for readers to deeply empathize with particular characters or situations. However, there is some room for introspection as it touches on universal concerns about power and control.",
    "empathy_score": 2.5,
  
    "engagement_explanation": "The premise is intriguing and speaks to contemporary concerns about media manipulation and power structures. This will engage readers familiar with such themes. However, the absence of a specific plot or character development might reduce its grip on a wider audience.",
    "engagement_score": 3,
  
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The narrative lacks individual characters, their internal conflicts, or development beyond societal observations. While it does provide commentary on the complexity of relationships between media, money, and power, it doesn't delve into the intricacies of individual character conflicts or their resolutions.",
