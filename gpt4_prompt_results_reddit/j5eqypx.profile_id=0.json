    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\n\"Quit your bullshit.

    "authentic_explanation": "The writing attempts to provide a perspective on the natural lifecycle and struggles of a hive's queen bee. However, the language and terminology used, such as 'Quit your bullshit' and 'simps', are not consistent with the natural setting of a hive and can detract from the sense of authenticity.",
    "authentic_score": 2,
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "There's an inherent tension in the narrative related to the cycle of life and death, the struggle for power, and the looming threat of a younger successor. However, the emotions are stated rather explicitly and could benefit from more nuanced depiction.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 3,
    "empathy_explanation": "The writing offers an insight into the potential anxieties and fears a queen bee might experience. Yet, the anthropomorphizing of the bees with human-centric language and terms makes it a bit harder to empathize with the actual creature.",

    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The story touches upon the life cycle, threat of successors, and the strategic choices a queen bee faces. While there's depth to the actual events, the narrative is more of a statement than a developed story.
