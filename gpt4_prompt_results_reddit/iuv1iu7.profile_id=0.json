I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.\n\nHowever cruel it is.\n\nI certainly didn\u2019t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as \u201ccheering\u201d.\n\nWere these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.\n\nHowever weird it was.\n\nIn the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.\n\nContrary to my expectations, they didn\u2019t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\n\u201cThe economy will collapse!\u201d One of them said, his tone identified as \u2018condescending\u2019. \u201cIf you give everyone homes and healthcare, nobody will want to work! You are just giving everyone a handout!\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks.

I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.\n\nEventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.\n\nHer answer was the most shocking.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,\u201d I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. \u201cYou spent one sixth of your day working.\u201d\n\nThe young woman looked at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.\n\n\u201cWe used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,\u201d she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. \u201cFive or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.\u201d\n\nI checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!\n\n\u201cEven the good jobs don\u2019t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.\u201d\n\nHalf? Willingly?\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 since we are talking here, may I ask a question?\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cWhy all the perks?\u201d She sounded sincere. \u201cI mean, I am enjoying all the free time and not having to worry that an ambulance ride will bankrupt me but\u2026 I think a lot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nI looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, \u201ccatch\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is none.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone at all? No eating our young or old?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolving the world hunger, too, huh?\u201d She smiled. \u201cOkay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are not going to, I don\u2019t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll due respect but we have evolved far beyond what your bodies could provide us with.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Just checking.\u201d\n\nThe young woman was soon let go.

    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nI finished my speech, fully prepared for the usual spectacle of protests and outrage.

    "authentic_explanation": "The story provides a fresh perspective by flipping the narrative of alien invasion. However, the authenticity is slightly compromised by the simplistic portrayal of human responses which seem to generalize a vast, diverse population into two broad categories: the elite and the lower classes.",

    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The story evokes some sense of intrigue, particularly when delving into the mystery of human reaction. The emotion is somewhat consistent but lacks variety, with the majority being intrigue and mild surprise.",

    "empathy_explanation": "The reader can certainly empathize with the alien leader's confusion and surprise, but the human emotions, especially of the masses, seem too generalized to evoke strong empathy. The individual human interviewee does add a touch of personal connection, though.",

    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The story brings forth a unique twist on the traditional alien invasion theme. Characters, especially the alien leader, show development and internal conflict.
