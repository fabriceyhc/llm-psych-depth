His existence as a vampire spanned centuries. Yet as the modern world progressed, Alexandre often found himself drifting further and further away from the joys and experiences of the living.\n\nIn the heart of the city, he owned a penthouse, high above the world, where darkness enveloped him like a comforting embrace. He rarely ventured out, instead watching the world through his wide glass windows. During the nights, he would witness the city\u2019s dazzling lights, but come morning, he would draw the thick curtains, shielded from the golden sun rays.\n\nOne evening, as Alexandre wandered the city streets, he came across a bustling store, its neon sign flashing \u201cGaming Central\u201d. Curiosity piqued, he entered, his senses instantly assaulted by the cacophony of sounds and sights. Screens displayed worlds he had never imagined: colorful terrains, dynamic characters, and vast sunlit landscapes. \n\nA store employee, a young woman with electric blue hair, approached him. \"First time here?\" she asked, noting his awestruck expression.\n\nHe nodded, \"I've been... out of touch with such novelties.\"\n\nShe introduced him to the concept of video games, and as he listened, Alexandre's eyes glittered with a childlike wonder. Here was a realm where he could walk under the sun, feel the warmth on his digital face, and experience a semblance of daylight.\n\nDriven by a newfound excitement, Alexandre transformed an entire section of his penthouse into a gaming haven. He dove headfirst into these virtual realms, exploring sunny beaches, hiking sunlit mountains, and dancing in virtual festivals under the bright blue sky.\n\nIn one game, he played as Leo, a sun-worshipping adventurer, navigating through a vibrant world. Alexandre would often position Leo on a cliff, just to watch the sunrise, the character basking in the glow Alexandre himself so deeply missed.\n\nBut the more he played, the more Alexandre craved real interactions. He missed the tangibility of life. So, he began inviting fellow gamers, introducing himself as an eccentric nocturnal millionaire with a penchant for gaming.\n\nOne such evening, as he played alongside his new friends, the electric blue-haired woman, Clara, now a dear friend, observed, \u201cYou know, you always choose to play during the daytime in these games.\u201d\n\nAlexandre paused, his character standing amidst a sun-drenched field. \u201cIt's been centuries since I felt the sun,\u201d he murmured, almost to himself.\n\nClara, sensing the deep emotion, leaned in, \"What if there was a way for you to experience it, even if just for a moment?\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Alexandre found himself standing on his penthouse balcony, a special UV-resistant suit designed by Clara clinging to his form. As dawn approached, Clara beside him, he hesitated only for a second before drawing back the curtains.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, Alexandre bathed in the sun's glow, its filtered warmth seeping through the suit. Tears glistened in his eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he whispered.\n\nClara smiled, \u201cSometimes, the virtual world leads us back to reality in the most unexpected ways.\"\n\nAnd in that golden hour, Alexandre, the age-old vampire, found a piece of his humanity restored, all thanks to a game and a chance encounter.",
