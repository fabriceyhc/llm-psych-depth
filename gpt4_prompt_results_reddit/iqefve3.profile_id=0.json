Don't ask me how I know.\n\nI was fighting with my girlfriend when I first decided to keep the clown nose. Let's call him Clappy for fun. So we're fighting, im squeezing Clappy, and I say \" Well i wish you were your sister!\"\n\nQue the music. That stupid gladiator entance song every circus uses. Next thing we know a clown in white makeup with big ass red afro comes into our apartment. He picks up my gf, who goes stiff as a board, and begins to leave with her.\n\nI'm frozen still.\n\nAfter failing to fit her through the door several times, he exits the door. Then, he leans back in and, with only his face and one hand visable, he wags 1 finger.\n\nNext, carrying her stiff as a board, this bafoon comes running in with my girlfriends sister. She looks completely complacent. He sets her down like a bowling pin. Then this jackass leans back, picks up his arms, and bolts from the apartment.\n\nNow, I can move. I ask Casey (my girlfriends sisters name) what just happened! She seems to know nothing, and is under the impression we are dating...and have been for years. Every memory i had with my girlfriend is now shared with her.\n\nMy girlfriend? Shes been missing ever since that day. Police are baffled where she could be.\n\nFuck this nose. Fuck Clappy. Tho, Casey is nice. And we do live debt free. Too bad I wished I was dead this morning.",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nFuck this clown nose!
