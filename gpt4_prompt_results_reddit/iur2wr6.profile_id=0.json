    "story": "Days before adopting Sam were usually quite the same. Staying in bed for entire time, watching Netflix, sometimes going out for groceries. I worked for IT company so everything could be done from my comfortable bed, no need to get to office. I was really lonely and overwhelmed when it came to human interactions. One of my online friends suggested I should adopt a dog. They are believed to keep a company to humans and I hoped it will make my overall state a bit better. I didn't expect it was going to turn out even worse.\n\nAfter looking at some ads about dogs available for adoption, I noticed one golden retriever named Sam. His owners described him as playful and full of energy. I thought to myself - \"That's what I need\". After a quick conversation, I was picking up Sam from across the town. The one thing that caught my attention, was how delighted were Sam owners when they handed me the leash. I didn't think about it until we get home. At first I thought Sam was just stressed and it was the reason behind his lack of intention to get out of the car. I quickly discover that in fact he is lacking intention to do anything. He didn't like going on walks, playing and in a matter of fact even eating. We made few checkups in nearby vets, but Sam seemed healthy...\n\nI looked online for any clue about his state, but there was little to nothing. That's when I discovered dog psychologist. I took Sam for a consultation, after half an hour we walked with a diagnosis - dog depression. Sam got prescribed some pills and I was instructed to keep him company through all of this. I was worried, but Sam was my only real life friend, so I was not letting him go without a fight. He started attending therapy twice a week, he was taking pills, we even managed to go out for walks sometimes. I wasn't easy, I wasn't taking much care of myself, the only thing that counted was Sam.\n\nI became really attached to him, he was like my family, that's why writing this feels so unrealistic. After seven months of taking care of him, I noticed something growing inside his stomach. He had tumor. Our schedule got even more busy, except of usual routine we started going to the regular vet at least three times a week. I was able to see life slowly leaving his body, day by day.\n\nOn 30th of October he passed, I lost the only living creature I ever truly cared about, I am alone once more and without any hopes. I truly loved him, but taking care of him made me exhausted. For the past seven months I was his service human. I lost contact even with my online friends because of lack of time. I don't see any reason to live anymore. How come the world be so cruel place that even a dog can get depressed and die. The only thing that brings me some peace, its the idea of Sam dying by my side - his true friend.",
