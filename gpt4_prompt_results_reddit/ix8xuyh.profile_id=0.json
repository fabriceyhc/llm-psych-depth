Please choose something quickly, as we close in two minutes.\"\n\nThe elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.\n\nJulia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. \"What about 'Anonymous'?\"\n\n\"Taken.\" The clerk was watching the clock.\n\n\"Tits McGee?\"\n\n\"He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.\"\n\n\"Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?\" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. \"How about this?\"\n\nThe clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nJulia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.\n\nAnderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.\n\nAnderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. \"The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.\"\n\n\"Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.\"\n\nAnderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. \"They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?\"\n\nAnderson turned to consult with an aide who had rushed onto the set.\n\n\"It seems like we do have a clear winner, folks.\" Julia froze as her face flashed up on the screen. The picture she'd submitted with her application.\n\n\"The next President of the United States is candidate 'None of the Above'.\"",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\n\"I'm sorry, but we already have a candidate registered under the name Puppies Apple Pie, you'll have to choose a different pseudonym.
