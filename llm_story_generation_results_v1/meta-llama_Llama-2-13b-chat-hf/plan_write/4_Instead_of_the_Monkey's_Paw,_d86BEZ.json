He spends most of his time playing video games, tinkering with electronics, and dreaming about all the cool things he'll be able to do once he can drive. He's a bit shy around girls and often gets flustered when talking to them, but he has a secret crush on Marla.\n\nMarla is happy to have finally found the courage to come out as non-binary, but they're also feeling a bit anxious about how their friends and family will react. They've always felt like they don't quite fit into society's expectations of gender, and they're worried that others will judge them for being different. They rely heavily on Jake for emotional support and are grateful for his unwavering acceptance.\n\nDr. Strangebeard is a bit of a recluse and has been living in his mansion on the edge of town for as long as anyone can remember. He's a brilliant scientist who spends most of his time conducting experiments and inventing strange gadgets. He has a dry sense of humor and enjoys poking fun at Jake and Marla's antics. Despite his gruff exterior, he cares deeply about his two young friends and often provides them with sage advice and encouragement.",
    "output": "\nThe Story:\n\nJake and Marla had been exploring the woods near their town for years, but they had never ventured far enough to stumble upon Dr. Strangebeard's mansion. That all changed one fateful day when they stumbled upon a mysterious object in the woods - the Clown's Nose. It was a small, rubbery thing that seemed to glow with an otherworldly energy. Without thinking, Jake picked it up and put it in his pocket.\n\nThe next day, Jake wished for the ability to drive without needing a license. To his surprise, he woke up to find that he had grown a large, red nose that looked suspiciously like the Clown's Nose he had found. Marla couldn't help but burst out laughing when she saw him, and even Dr. Strangebeard cracked a smile.\n\nAt first, Jake was mortified. He had always been self-conscious about his appearance, and now he felt like a complete fool. But as the days passed, he began to see the humor in the situation. People would honk and wave at him as he drove by, and he even started wearing a clown costume to school. He realized that the Clown's Nose had granted his wish in the funniest way possible, rather than the worst way possible like the Monkey's Paw.\n\nAs Jake and Marla explored the mansion, they discovered that Dr. Strangebeard had been working on a machine that could grant wishes. They convinced him to test it out on Jake's wish, and to their surprise, it worked. But instead of simply giving Jake the ability to drive without a license, the machine made him look like a clown.\n\nDr. Strangebeard explained that the machine had taken Jake's wish and twisted it into something humorous because it sensed that he needed a bit of levity in his life. Jake realized that the Clown's Nose had been trying to tell him something - that sometimes, the best way to achieve your goals is to approach them with a sense of humor.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Jake learned to embrace his newfound clown identity. He started performing pranks and tricks for his classmates, and even landed a gig as a birthday party clown. He discovered that he had a knack for making people laugh, and it brought him a sense of joy and fulfillment that he had never experienced before.\n\nIn the end, Jake realized that the Clown's Nose had given him more than just a silly appearance - it had given him the gift of laughter and a newfound appreciation for the absurdity of life. And as he drove through the town with his bright red nose and oversized shoes, he knew that he would always be grateful for the lesson he had learned from the Clown's Nose."
