    "story_prompt": "Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.",
    "characters": "\nHere is one possible set of characters:\n\n1. Sarah: A young mother who had always struggled to make ends meet, even before the aliens arrived. She now has to work long hours in a factory, but at least her children are provided for by the aliens. She's grateful for this and tries to be as obedient as possible to keep her family safe. But she secretly dreams of rebellion and freedom.\n2. Tom: A charismatic and passionate man who used to be a community organizer before the aliens took over. He's determined to fight back against the aliens and restore humanity's rights and freedoms. However, his efforts have been foiled so far, and he's beginning to feel desperate and frustrated.\n3. Maria: A brilliant scientist who had been working on a top-secret project to develop a new form of renewable energy. The aliens took over just as she was about to reveal her findings to the world. Now, she's forced to work in an alien research facility, studying their technology and trying to understand their motivations. She's torn between her desire to learn more about the aliens and her resentment towards them for taking over her planet.",
    "output": "\nStory:\n\nSarah, Tom, and Maria sat in their small living quarters, huddled around a small table. The aliens had provided them with basic necessities, but they were still struggling to adjust to their new lives.\n\n\"I can't believe we have to work four hours a day, four days a week,\" Sarah said, shaking her head. \"It's not much better than what we had before.\"\n\n\"At least we have shelter and food,\" Tom reminded her. \"We should be grateful for that.\"\n\nMaria nodded, but her eyes seemed distant. \"I know. But it's not just about survival. It's about freedom. We can't just accept this new reality without a fight.\"\n\nSarah sighed. \"I know, Maria. But what can we do? The aliens have taken over our planet. They have the technology and the power. What can we possibly do to stop them?\"\n\nTom leaned forward, his eyes blazing with determination. \"We may not have their technology or their power, but we have something they don't: our humanity. We have compassion, empathy, and love. And those are the things that will ultimately bring them down.\"\n\nMaria looked at him, her expression softening. \"You really believe that, don't you?\"\n\nTom nodded. \"I do. And I think we all do, deep down. We just need to find a way to channel that belief into action.\"\n\nSarah stood up, her eyes brimming with tears. \"I want to believe that too. But it's hard, when everything around us feels so hopeless.\"\n\nTom reached out and took her hand. \"I know it's hard, Sarah. But we have to keep holding on to each other, and to our own humanity. That's the only way we'll get through this.\"\n\nAs they hugged each other tightly, Maria spoke up. \"You know, I've been thinking... maybe we can use our own humanity against them. Maybe we can find a way to use their own technology against them.\"\n\nTom's eyes lit up. \"That's it! That's the key to our freedom!\"\n\nAnd with renewed hope and determination, the three of them began to plot their rebellion against the alien overlords."
