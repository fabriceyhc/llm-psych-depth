    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure. When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "characters": "\nCharacters:\n\n1) The Demon - A high ranking member of Lucifer's staff who has been tasked with keeping an eye on you. He seems friendly enough but his true intentions may not be entirely pure.\n\n2) The Angel - An angel who was assigned to guide you through your stay in Hell. She appears kind and compassionate but her patience is wearing thin due to your constant mistakes.\n\n3) Yourself - You have found yourself in a strange new world and are struggling to cope with the rules and customs of this place. Despite your best efforts, you keep making mistakes and causing trouble for those around you.",
    "output": "\nAs I opened my eyes, I found myself standing in a beautiful garden filled with vibrant flowers and towering trees. The air was warm and fragrant, and the sound of birdsong filled my ears. I couldn't believe it \u2013 had I really died and gone to heaven?\n\nBut as I looked around, I noticed something odd. Everyone here seemed so... happy. They were all smiling and laughing, and their faces glowed with an otherworldly light. And then, a figure approached me.\n\n\"Hello there!\" he said, flashing a charming grin. \"My name is Baal, and I'm here to help you navigate this lovely place.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"Navigate?\" I repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nBaal chuckled. \"Oh, just little things like avoiding eternal torment and finding your way to the better parts of town. You know, the usual.\"\n\nI frowned, feeling a sense of unease creeping over me. Something about Baal didn't seem right. But before I could question him further, a woman appeared at my side.\n\n\"Hi there,\" she said softly. \"My name is Ariel, and I'm here to guide you through your stay in Hell.\"\n\nI blinked, confused. \"Hell?\" I repeated. \"Didn't you say this was heaven?\"\n\nAriel sighed. \"I apologize for any confusion. This is indeed Hell, but don't worry \u2013 it's not as bad as you might think. Well, not too much anyway.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to make sense of everything. But before I could ask another question, Baal spoke up again.\n\n\"Don't mind Ariel, she's just a bit... strict sometimes. But I promise, I'll take care of you. After all, I've been doing this job for a while now.\"\n\nI hesitated, unsure of whom to trust. But as I looked into Baal's eyes, I saw something there that made my blood run cold. It was a glint of malice, a hint of something dark lurking beneath the surface.\n\nAnd in that moment, I knew that I was in grave danger."
