    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure. When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "characters": "\nNote: Please do not describe your characters as \"demons\" as they are more likely to be humans with specific traits or motivations. Instead focus on their roles within the scene.\n\nHere is an example to help guide your responses:\n\nCharacters:\n\n1. Name: Michael\nRole: Angel\nEmotional State: Nervous\nInner Thoughts: \"I hope I don't screw this up. I've been assigned to guide this soul through hell, but I've never done it before. What if I lead them astray? What if they see through my disguise?\"\n\n2. Name: Lucifer\nRole: The Devil\nEmotional State: Bored\nInner Thoughts: \"Another soul in hell? How cliche. I wish these humans would stop making the same mistakes over and over again. Oh well, at least this one is entertaining. They think they're in heaven.\"\n\nNow it's your turn! Please provide the following information for 2-3 major characters in the scene:\n\n1. Name:\n2. Role:\n3. Emotional State:\n4. Inner Thoughts:\n\nPlease let me know when you have finished.",
    "output": "\nNote: Your character will be a human who has awoken in hell, and will be guided by an angel through their time in hell. Your story should explore the emotional depth of both characters, particularly as they come to understand each other and their respective roles in the afterlife.\n\nGood luck!"
