    "output": "    \n\nI want this story to be as emotionally engaging as possible with well developed characters. Make sure the pacing, dialogue, and descriptive language bring out a sense of tension, suspense, mystery, fear and emotional pain.\n\nStory: \nYou had heard whispers of your wife's estranged sister since the day you married her. It was always just a passing mention, a quick glance, or a softly spoken name. Your wife, Elena, would never go into detail about her, and you never pressed the matter. It wasn't until after the wedding that you learned the reason for her estrangement - her sister, Isabella, had been murdered just a week before your ceremony.\n\nThe police had never found the killer, and Elena's grief had consumed her. You thought that was the end of it, but as time passed, you noticed something odd. Elena would sometimes look at you with a gaze that made your skin crawl. It was as if she could see right through you, like she knew all your secrets. You brushed it off as a symptom of her grief, but then, one day, you found an old family photo in the attic.\n\nIt was an image of two little girls, identical in every way, smiling brightly at the camera. One was Elena, and the other was...you. Your heart raced as you realized the truth - you and Elena were twins. Someone had taken her sister, and now they had taken your wife. The feeling of being watched intensified, and you couldn't shake the feeling that someone was in the room with you, waiting for you to make a wrong move.\n\nOne night, you were sitting in the living room when you heard footsteps upstairs. You knew it wasn't Elena; she had gone to bed hours ago. The creaks grew louder, and you felt a presence hovering above you. Suddenly, a picture frame fell off the wall, shattering into pieces. You leapt up and ran to the stairs, calling out to Elena. There was no answer. You ascended the stairs, your heart pounding, until you reached the door to the attic.\n\nThe air inside was stale and musty, and the smell of decay filled your nostrils. You fumbled for the light switch, but before you could find it, a hand reached out from the darkness and turned it off. You were plunged into blackness, unable to see anything around you. You tried to call out to Elena again, but your voice was hoarse and barely audible. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, standing just inches away from you.\n\nYou could only make out the outline of their form, but you could sense their hatred and malevolence radiating towards you. A whisper seemed to drift across your ear, sending shivers down your spine - \"You took my sister; now I'll take yours.\" Your heart raced, knowing that the killer was in front of you. The air in the attic seemed to grow colder by the second, and your mind screamed at you to run, but your feet felt rooted to the spot.\n\nThen, everything went blank. When you came to, you were lying on the floor, your head throbbing. Elena was sitting next to you, holding your hand and looking at you with tears streaming down her face. You asked her what happened, but she just shook her head and said she didn't know. She kept saying over and over again that she didn't do it, that she didn't kill anyone.\n\nAs you tried to piece together what happened, you couldn't shake the feeling that you were being watched, that the killer was still out there, waiting for their next victim. You knew that you needed to protect Elena, but how could you do it when you didn't even know who the killer was? The only thing you knew for certain was that your life would never be the same again."
