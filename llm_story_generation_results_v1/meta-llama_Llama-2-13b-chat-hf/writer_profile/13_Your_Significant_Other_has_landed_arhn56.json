    "story_prompt": "Your Significant Other has landed a book publishing deal! You're very proud of them, even if you don't actually enjoy their writing. One day, on a whim, you buy an actual copy in a book store. It's nothing like the pages they gave you to read. Nothing.",
    "output": "\n---\n\nI strolled down the aisles of the bookstore, my hands shoved into the pockets of my jeans. My partner had just announced that their self-published novel had been picked up by a traditional publisher, and I was still trying to wrap my head around it all. It was like a dream come true for them, but I couldn't help feeling a tad disconnected from the situation.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I was proud of my partner. They had put their heart and soul into this book, pouring all their emotions onto the page. But, in all honesty, I had never been too fond of their writing style. It was too flowery, too over-the-top, and often left me scratching my head in confusion. However, as their significant other, I knew how much this meant to them, so I kept my opinions to myself.\n\nAs I wandered through the bookstore, I noticed a copy of my partner's book sitting on a shelf. I couldn't resist picking it up, curious to see what the published version looked like. But as soon as I opened the cover, I knew something was off. The words on the page didn't match the drafts they had shown me. The tone was different, the dialogue was different, and the plot had taken a completely unexpected turn.\n\nI flipped through the pages, my mind racing with questions. How could this have happened? Had my partner changed the story without telling me? Or was this some kind of mistake? I decided to take the book to my partner and ask them about it.\n\nWhen I arrived home, my partner was sitting at their desk, staring at a blank page. They looked up as I approached them, a mixture of excitement and nerves etched on their face.\n\n\"Hey, I found something interesting today,\" I said, holding out the book. \"Do you know anything about this?\"\n\nMy partner's eyes widened as they took the book from me. \"This is the published version!\" they exclaimed. \"I thought you just wanted to read the drafts.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, this is different. The words on the page don't match what you showed me before.\"\n\nMy partner looked confused for a moment, then their face lit up. \"Oh, that must be the editor's changes. They cleaned up the writing, added some plot points, and tweaked the character arcs. I didn't want to show you the drafts until they were finalized.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a mix of relief and curiosity. \"So, this is what your book looks like now?\"\n\nMy partner nodded, beaming with pride. \"Yeah, it's pretty great, huh?\"\n\nI smiled, trying to hide my confusion. \"Yeah, it's...interesting.\"\n\nMy partner laughed. \"Well, I'm glad you think so. And hey, maybe now you'll finally understand what I've been trying to say all these years.\"\n\nI chuckled, knowing that my partner would always be a little out of reach, but that was okay. As long as they were happy, I was happy too. And who knows, maybe one day I'd even learn to appreciate their writing."
