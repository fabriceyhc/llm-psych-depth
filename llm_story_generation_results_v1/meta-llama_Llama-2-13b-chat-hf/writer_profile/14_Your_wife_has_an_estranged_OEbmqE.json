    "output": "    \nPlease write a 500-word story based on this prompt.\n\nStory:\n\nTitle: The Lost Twin\n\nI've always been skeptical of ghost stories, the supernatural, and all things eerie. My wife's estranged sister's murder, which happened just after we got married, only solidified my stance. It was a senseless act of violence that left behind nothing but questions and heartache.\n\nBut lately, I've started to notice something strange about my wife. She's become distant, lost in thought, often whispering to herself or staring at something only she can see. At first, I dismissed it as grief, assuming she was still grappling with the loss of her sister. However, as time passed, these occurrences became more frequent and pronounced.\n\nOne evening, as I sat on the couch, I saw my wife rummaging through an old family photo album. Her eyes scanned the pictures, lingering on each one before slowly closing the album. She seemed lost in thought, and I knew something was bothering her.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" I asked, placing my hand on her shoulder.\n\nShe hesitated before speaking, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I found something in the attic today.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" I asked, leaning closer.\n\n\"A picture of me and...her,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"We looked exactly alike.\"\n\nMy mind raced as I pieced together the information. An estranged sister, a murder, and now this. I didn't know what to make of it, but my instincts told me to listen carefully.\n\n\"Do you mean...your twin?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nMy wife nodded, tears streaming down her face. \"Yes, I never told you. We were twins.\"\n\nThe revelation sent shivers down my spine. I felt a chill run down my back as if someone was watching us. The air in the room grew heavier, and I could swear I heard a faint whisper.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"After the murder, our parents split us apart. They said it was too much for one family to handle, two sisters dead within a year of each other. They put me in foster care, told everyone I was an only child.\"\n\nThe weight of her words hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn't believe the truth I had been oblivious to for so long.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" I asked, my voice laced with frustration.\n\n\"I was afraid,\" she said, looking down. \"Afraid of being judged, of losing you.\"\n\nMy heart ached for her. I knew I had to be there for her, support her through this difficult time.\n\nAs the night wore on, we talked long into the night, piecing together our lives, trying to make sense of everything. The cold case of her sister's murder remained unsolved, but we both knew now that her spirit was still with us, watching over us.\n\nI realized then that sometimes, the truth can be haunting, but it can also set us free. I promised myself then and there that I would stand by my wife, through thick and thin, no matter what secrets the past held."
