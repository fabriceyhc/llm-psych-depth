    "output": "\n---\n\n\"Dude, what's up with this thing?\" Tim asked his best friend Matt, holding up the Clown's Nose they had found at the thrift store.\nMatt shrugged. \"Beats me. It looks like a rubber nose or something.\"\nTim examined it more closely. The nose was made of bright red rubber, and it had a wide, goofy grin painted on it. \"It kinda looks like a clown nose,\" he observed.\n\n\"Yeah, duh,\" Matt replied. \"But what's so special about it?\"\nTim grinned mischievously. \"I bet it does something weird, like that Monkey's Paw thing in that old story.\"\nMatt rolled his eyes. \"You mean the one where the monkey grants wishes but in the worst possible way? Please tell me we're not gonna use this thing.\"\nTim chuckled. \"Nah, man. I'm pretty sure this thing will be way more fun. Let's give it a try!\"\n\nThey sat down cross-legged on the floor, the Clown's Nose between them. Tim closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and wished aloud, \"I wish for a year's supply of pizza!\"\n\nA split second later, a giant pie appeared out of thin air and landed with a thud right next to them. Tim burst out laughing. \"Holy crap, it worked!\"\nMatt groaned good-naturedly. \"This is gonna be a long year...\"\n\nOver the next few days, Tim and Matt used the Clown's Nose to make increasingly absurd wishes. They wished for giant talking hamsters, flying ice cream cones, and even a robotic chicken dance party. Each time, their wish was granted in the most ridiculous way possible, leaving them in stitches.\n\nOne day, Tim decided to take things up a notch. \"Matt, I wish for the most epic birthday party ever!\"\n\nThe room around them began to shimmer and change. Suddenly, they were standing in a colorful, neon-lit dance club filled with clowns, balloons, and confetti. A live band blasted out a catchy tune as dozens of partygoers danced and cheered.\n\nMatt raised an eyebrow. \"Uh, Tim? This is a little much, don't you think?\"\n\nTim grinned, beaming with excitement. \"No way, dude! This is awesome! Let's get this party started!\"\n\nAnd with that, they dove headfirst into the wildest, most hilarious birthday party either of them had ever seen. The Clown's Nose had granted their wish in the funniest way possible, filling their lives with laughter and joy.\n\nAs the party wound down and the guests departed, Tim turned to Matt with a grin. \"Thanks for being such a good sport, dude. That was totally the best birthday ever!\"\nMatt chuckled, shaking his head. \"I should have known better than to doubt the power of the Clown's Nose.\"\n\nAnd so, the two friends continued to use the mysterious object to make wishes, always laughing and enjoying themselves in the absurd and hilarious ways it granted their desires."
