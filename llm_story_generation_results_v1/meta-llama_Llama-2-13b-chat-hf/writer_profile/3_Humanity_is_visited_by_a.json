    "story_prompt": "Humanity is visited by a cosmic horror the likes of which has only been seen in Lovecraftian horror. In desperation, Earth throws everything we have at it, and, miraculously, the human race has killed a God. Somewhere in a realm beyond our understanding, the other gods speak of the event.",
    "output": "\n\"What was it about those humans that made them capable of such a feat?\" one asks.\n\n\"They had something we do not,\" another replies. \"A capacity for love.\"\n\nThe first god scoffs. \"Love? Ha! That's what did us in. We underestimated their ability to feel, to care, to hurt...and ultimately, to kill.\"\n\nBut as the gods continue their discussion, they begin to realize that there may be hope for humanity yet. For even in the face of unspeakable terror, the humans found a way to come together, to support one another, and to overcome. And perhaps, just perhaps, this capacity for love will be enough to save them all."
