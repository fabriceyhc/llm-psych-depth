    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure. When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "output": " \nAs a human, you struggle to understand how you ended up in Hell despite leading a relatively good life. You always tried to be kind to others, worked hard at your job, and never did anything intentionally cruel or hurtful. Yet here you are, surrounded by flames and screams, with a red-skinned demon hovering nearby.\n\u201cHow did I end up here?\u201d you ask the demon, who seems to take great delight in your confusion.\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t exactly a 'good' deed that brought you here,\u201d he replies, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201cIn fact, it was probably the complete opposite.\u201d\nYou press him for details, but the demon remains evasive, only offering cryptic hints and vague suggestions. It becomes clear that he\u2019s enjoying your discomfort and confusion almost as much as he\u2019s enjoying your eternal suffering.\nDespite the heat and torment, you begin to wonder if maybe there\u2019s something you could have done differently \u2013 something that might have prevented you from ending up in this awful place. Was there something you could have said or done that would have earned you a pass to the good deed heaven instead?\nAs the demon continues to taunt you, you become consumed by regret and sorrow. You realize that even though you lived a mostly good life, there were still moments when you were selfish or cruel \u2013 moments that may have sealed your fate.\nBut then, suddenly, a glimmer of hope flickers within you. What if, despite all the mistakes and missteps, you still have the chance to make things right? What if there\u2019s still time to make amends and find a way out of this hellhole?\nWith renewed determination, you turn to the demon and demand, \u201cWhat do I need to do to get out of here? How can I make things right?\u201d\nThe demon lets out a maniacal cackle, clearly pleased by your newfound resolve. \u201cOh, you want to make things right? Well, that\u2019s going to take some work, my dear,\u201d he says, his eyes glinting with malice. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we can come to an arrangement.\u201d"
