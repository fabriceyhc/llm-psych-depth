    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "\nAs I walked through the old family photo album with my wife, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It wasn't just the nostalgic gaze at our younger selves that made me feel this way \u2013 it was something else, something hidden beneath the surface. My wife seemed lost in thought, her eyes glancing off the images before us, and I knew she was thinking about her sister.\nHer twin sister, that is.\nThe one she had never spoken of before we got married. The one who had been murdered shortly after we tied the knot. I had brushed off her odd behavior since then as grief, but now, as I flipped through these faded memories, I wondered if there was more to it.\nA sudden shiver ran down my spine as I realized why my wife seemed so distant lately. I didn't know much about this estranged sister, only that she existed. But looking at these photos, I could see the resemblance between my wife and the young girl staring back at us \u2013 so similar that it took my breath away. I felt like I was gazing at her doppelganger, unsettling and familiar at the same time.\n\"Lily,\" my wife said softly, breaking me out of my thoughts. I turned to face her, wondering if she sensed my unease. \"I never told you about Sarah.\"\nShe reached for my hand, holding it tightly as she spoke. \"It's a long story, and it's painful, but I need to tell someone.\" Her voice cracked, and I saw tears threatening to spill over. \"Sarah was my twin sister, and she was taken from me before either of us even had a chance to live.\"\nMy mind raced as she began to share the story of how they grew up together, how they looked almost identical, how they shared their whole life without even knowing it. And how, one day, Sarah was gone, taken by some monster no one would ever catch.\nTears streaming down my cheeks, I listened to my wife's tale of grief and loss. We sat together, hand in hand, lost in the sorrow that bound us both. I didn't know what to say, but I held her close, willing myself to make her feel less alone in this pain.\nAfter a while, my wife finally pulled away, wiping her eyes and sniffling. She nodded before speaking again, her voice steady and firm. \"I know it's been twenty years since Sarah died, but I think about her every day. Every single day. She's my sister, and I will always love her, no matter how much time passes.\"\nAs I watched her struggle to come to terms with this lost part of herself, I knew what I had to do. I would stand by her side and support her in any way possible. Together, we would navigate this darkness and bring some light into the shadows. For Sarah, for my wife, and for ourselves, I vowed to be there, always."
