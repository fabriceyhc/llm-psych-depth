    "story_prompt": "You are allowed to 'downvote' a government candidate instead of voting normally, reducing their votes by one. Turns out people have little love for politicians, and the majority end with negative votes. In these democracies, anonymity is the key to winning.",
    "output": "\nYou find yourself standing outside the polling station, staring at the list of candidates running for office. They all seem so similar, each with their own empty promises and self-serving rhetoric. You wonder if any of them truly care about the people they're supposed to represent. As you ponder this, you notice a small, inconspicuous button on the door of the polling station. It's labeled 'Downvote'.\n\nAt first, you think it's some kind of prank or joke, but as you look around, you realize no one else seems to be paying attention to it. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you decide to investigate further. Pressing the button leads to a secret room hidden within the station, where you discover a computer system with the profiles of all the candidates. Each one has a number assigned to it, and when you enter a number, a counter beside it starts counting down. The more people who downvote a candidate, the faster the counter drops.\n\nYou realize that this is the only way to truly hold politicians accountable, by using their own system against them. You spend the day downvoting every candidate, watching their counters drop dramatically. As more and more people join in, you notice something strange - the ones with the lowest counters start to disappear.\nIt turns out that the more people who downvote a candidate, the less likely they are to win the election. The system seems to favor those who are most hated, and soon enough, only the most despised candidates remain. And as the day goes on, the line of people waiting to downvote grows longer and longer.\n\nIn the end, you're left wondering if this is the best way to choose leaders, or if it's just a twisted game designed to pit people against each other. The thought sends a shiver down your spine, but you know you won't stop fighting for what's right. Because sometimes, the only way to make a change is to go against the system entirely.\n\nHow would you describe the overall tone of this story? What emotions does it evoke in the reader?"
