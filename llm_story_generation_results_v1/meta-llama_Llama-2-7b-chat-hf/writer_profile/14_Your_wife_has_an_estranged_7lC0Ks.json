    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "\n\nI stared at the old family photo, my mind reeling with the implications. My wife, Sarah, and her estranged sister, Emily, were identical twins. I had known this, of course, but it had never really registered until now. How could it have, when I had never even met Emily?\nIt had been years since the tragedy occurred. Emily had been murdered, and Sarah had been left alone to pick up the pieces. At first, I had thought her recent strange behavior was just grief resurfacing after all these years. But now, looking at that photo, I realized that something more was going on.\nSarah's eyes seemed to pierce through me, as if she could see right into my soul. Her smile was tinged with sadness, as if she knew a secret that no one else did. And yet, despite her twin sister's death, there was something unnervingly familiar about her. It was as if she was trying to tell me something, to reach out across the gaping chasm of time and loss.\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as I looked at the photo. I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to meet Emily. What would she have been like? Would we have been close? And what had happened to her that fateful night?\nThe questions swirled around my head like a cyclone, making it hard to focus on anything else. I tried to push them away, telling myself it was just my imagination running wild. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. That Sarah was hiding something from me, something important.\nAs the days passed, I found myself drawn back to that photo again and again. I couldn't explain why, but there was something about it that gripped me, made me feel like I was on the verge of something big.\nAnd then, one night, I saw it. A flash of movement out of the corner of my eye, as if someone was standing just behind me. I spun around, but there was no one there.\nThat was when I realized that Emily was still with us. She was here, somehow, watching over us from beyond the grave. I didn't know how to explain it, or what it meant, but I knew that my life was about to change forever."
