    "output": "\nAs you hold the small wooden box, adorned with painted clown faces, you can't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with a hint of trepidation.\n\nWithout thinking twice, you open the box, revealing a fuzzy white nose. You're about to close it when a voice behind you speaks up.\n\"Ah-ah! Where do you think you're going?\" The voice sounds amused and mischievous, as if it knows something you don't.\nYou turn around to see a jolly old clown peering at you through a hole in his oversized red nose.\n\"What's this thing?\" you ask, trying to hide your nervousness.\nThe clown chuckles and takes the box from your hands, examining it closely.\n\"This? Oh, this is no ordinary nose! It grants wishes... in the funniest way possible!\" he exclaims, almost bursting into laughter.\nYour eyes widen in surprise, and you must admit the idea of getting something you want while being tickled silly by a clown's antics is strangely appealing.\n\"So go ahead,\" the clown says with a sly smile. \"Make your wish.\"\nDo you:\nA) Wish for something serious, like eternal happiness or superpowers.\nB) Wish for something silly, like a talking pet rock or a giant pizza that never stops smiling.\nC) Decline and try to return the nose to its owner, feeling that this is too absurd a situation for your liking.\nD) Other (please specify in comments)."
