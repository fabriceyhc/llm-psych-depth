    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "\n\n---\n\nAs I sit here staring at the old family photo, my mind races with questions and doubts. How could I have been so blind? My wife, Sarah, had always been tight-lipped about her past, but I never suspected anything like this. The image before me shows two little girls, one with bright blue eyes and golden locks, the other with dark hair and piercing brown eyes \u2013 identical in every way except for their features. It's uncanny how similar they look, almost as if they were meant to be together. But why did she keep it hidden away? Why didn't she tell me sooner?\nI try to push aside my growing unease and focus on the facts. Sarah's sister, Emily, was killed in a brutal murder when we were still dating. Her body was found in a park, battered and bruised beyond recognition. The police investigation led nowhere, and the case remained unsolved for years. Afterward, Sarah became increasingly distant and withdrawn, barely leaving our apartment or interacting with friends. At first, I thought it was just grief taking its toll, but something didn't add up. Now, looking back, I realize how much she changed after Emily died.\nThe memories come flooding back, haunting me like ghosts. The way she would wander around the house late at night, muttering to herself, or the way she would break down in tears over seemingly insignificant things. I tried to comfort her, but she pushed me away, saying she needed time alone. I assumed it was just part of healing, but now I wonder if there was something else going on beneath the surface.\nMy thoughts race ahead, trying to make sense of everything. Could Sarah's sister really be alive all these years later? Is that why she's been acting strangely? And what does any of this mean for us? Our marriage already felt fragile; now, with these secrets coming to light, I fear for our future together.\nDespite my racing heart and clammy palms, I know I need to confront Sarah about this discovery. We owe it to Emily, to ourselves, and to whatever truth lies buried beneath the surface. As I reach for my phone to call her, though, my hand hesitates mid-air. What will happen next? Will she deny it? Will she finally open up to me? Or will this revelation tear us apart? Only time will tell."
