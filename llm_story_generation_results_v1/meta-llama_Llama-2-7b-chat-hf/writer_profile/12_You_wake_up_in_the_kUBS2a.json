    "story_prompt": "You wake up in the middle of the night, your arm hangs over the side of your bed. It\u2019s pitch black & your room is shrouded in deep shadow. Something unseen seizes your hand. You grasp it tightly, knowing that first impressions are important & a firm, confident handshake establishes dominance.",
    "output": "As you open your eyes, a figure emerges from the darkness. Their face is blurry at first but as they take a step closer, their features come into focus. You see the same face you stared at during those sleepless nights when your infant cried nonstop for hours, days, weeks, & months. Now this face looks back at you with equal exhaustion & helplessness etched on its every line.\n\u201cYou look terrible,\u201d you tell them. They don\u2019t argue. The voice that speaks in return is husky with fatigue & the words are barely above a whisper. You lean in close, as if that could somehow amplify their voices. Your nose almost touches theirs, breath mingling in the darkness. The weight of this connection is palpable, like two people grasping for air in an ocean of isolation.\nYou feel the softest pressure on your mouth, as though the other person is gently nudging you awake. In that moment, you wonder if the exhaustion you both share isn\u2019t simply the byproduct of living, but the actual point of existence. And if so, what kind of universe would allow such beauty amidst so much desolation?"
