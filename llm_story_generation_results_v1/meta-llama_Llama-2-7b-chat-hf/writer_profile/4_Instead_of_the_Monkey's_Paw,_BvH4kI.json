    "output": "\n---\n\nAs I walked through the dusty attic, my eyes scanned the shelves filled with old trinkets and heirlooms. My grandfather had passed away recently, leaving behind this treasure trove of memories. Amongst the various knick-knacks was one peculiar item - a red rubber clown nose. It seemed out of place amongst the other relics, but something about it caught my eye.\nI picked it up, feeling its squishiness between my fingers. Suddenly, a voice boomed from above, \"What do you want, youngster?\"\nStartled, I looked up to see an elderly man perched on a ladder, peering down at me with a mischievous grin. He wore a bright red wig and a painted-on smile, giving him the appearance of a circus clown.\n\"Uh,\" I stuttered, unsure how to respond. The clown chuckled and said, \"Don't worry, kid! This ol' nose might look silly, but it holds some magic!\"\nHe explained that the clown's nose could grant wishes in the most hilarious ways imaginable. With each wish made, the clown would perform a prank or skit, bringing laughter and joy to those involved.\nMy mind raced as I considered what I wanted to wish for. A million bucks? World peace? Nope, none of those felt quite right. Then, inspiration struck - I wished for the ability to make everyone around me break out into spontaneous dance parties whenever they heard music!\nThe clown nodded enthusiastically before disappearing in a puff of smoke. When he returned, he held a tiny drum set and began banging away with gleeful abandon. Music started blaring throughout the attic, filling the air with infectious beats. People began dancing uncontrollably, laughing and smiling as they twirled and grooved.\nIt wasn't long before we were all having the time of our lives, lost in the pure joy of movement and sound. Even Grandpa's ghost joined in, swaying back and forth with a contented smile on his face.\nFrom that day forward, anytime someone put on music, people within earshot would start dancing without warning. It became a beloved phenomenon, spreading happiness wherever it went. And every time I thought of that magical clown's nose, I couldn't help but smile."
