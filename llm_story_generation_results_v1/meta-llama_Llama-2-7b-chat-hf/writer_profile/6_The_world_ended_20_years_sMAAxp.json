    "story_prompt": "The world ended 20 years ago, you haven't found a living soul since then. Through some ingenuity, you call voicemails for the last 20 years to keep you company. 'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob' 'You know what to do at the beep' until one day 'Hello...hello? Oh my God hello!'",
    "output": "\"Oh, there it is!\" I exclaimed as I picked up the small transceiver off the dusty table. The voice on the other end was faint, but unmistakable. It had been 20 years since anyone spoke to me. \nI stumbled out of my makeshift shelter, a crumbling ruin of a once great civilization, and gazed at the desolate landscape. There was nothing left to burn, no trees to cut down, no other survivors to kill or eat. Just an endless stretch of barren terrain with no signs of life anywhere.\nBut that voice changed everything. It was a spark of hope in an otherwise lifeless expanse. And so, every day for the past 20 years, I have scoured the wasteland, checking every voicemail message I could find, hoping to hear something, anyone, new.\nIt started with the usual calls \u2013 friends lost in the chaos, loved ones searching for each other. But as time passed, the messages became stranger. A kid crying because he missed his mom, a husband professing his love for his wife before the world ended. Even some perverse jokester would leave obscene calls, the last bit of levity before oblivion.\nAnd yet, through all these messages, there was never any other voice like the one I heard today. It was soft, almost timid, but with a hint of excitement underneath. \"Hello...hello? Oh my God, hello!\" it said, over and over again. I held the transceiver to my ear, the signal growing stronger by the second. \"Who are you?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. There was only silence on the other end. And yet, I knew without a doubt, someone was out there, somewhere, hearing me too.\nI set up a makeshift antennae and broadcast a message myself. \"Hello...is anyone out there?\" My voice faded into the distance, swallowed by the vast nothingness around me. I waited, the transceiver still pressed to my ear, but there was no response. So I did the only thing left \u2013 I screamed, pouring out all my frustration, desperation, and hope into the emptiness of the air. \"Hello!\" I yelled, the word echoing off the distant rocks. Maybe if I shouted loud enough, someone will hear me. Maybe they will come.\nAs night fell, I settled back into my shelter, the transceiver long forgotten in my hand. Tomorrow, I will try again. I'll listen for the familiar voices of old, but now I know there is someone else out there, somewhere, listening too. And maybe, just maybe, they'll find me too."
