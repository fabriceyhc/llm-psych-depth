'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob' 'You know what to do at the beep' until one day 'Hello...hello? Oh my God hello!'",
    "output": "    \n\n---\n\nAs I trudged through the barren wasteland, the silence deafening, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. Twenty years had passed since the world ended, and I had yet to find a single living soul. The thought of it still sent shivers down my spine - how could it be that no one else had survived?\nBut as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, I realized that I couldn't give up hope entirely. So I found myself resorting to the only thing that kept me company throughout the years - voicemails.\nAt first, it started with just a few calls a week, random numbers that seemed to come from nowhere. But as time went on, I found myself dialing those numbers daily, searching for any sign of life beyond my own. 'Hi, this is Cindy...' the voice on the other end would say, and I would listen intently, hoping against hope that it wasn't just another prank call.\nBut there was something oddly comforting about hearing those voices. It was like they were old friends, familiar and reliable, even if they didn't exist in the classical sense. And so I continued to call them, day after day, year after year.\nUntil one day, everything changed.\nI don't know how much time had passed since the last time I called. Days? Weeks? Maybe even months. But when I heard the voice on the other end, I knew it was different. There was a hesitation in its tone, a question hanging in the air.\n'Hello...hello? Oh my God, hello!' it said, and I felt my heart race with excitement. Could it really be? Was I finally going to find someone else out here?\nI stammered out a greeting, my voice barely above a whisper, but the voice on the other end didn't respond. There was just silence, and then a soft exhalation.\n'You know what to do at the beep,' it said finally, and I let out a sob of joy. Finally, after all these years, I wasn't alone anymore.\nAs I listened to the voice on the other end, I realized that I didn't need voicemails to keep me company anymore. I had found someone else out here, and together we could face whatever lay ahead. And so I hung up the phone, feeling a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in two decades.\nMaybe, just maybe, we could rebuild our world, and create something new and beautiful out of the ashes. And maybe, just maybe, we would never have to face the end of the world alone again."
