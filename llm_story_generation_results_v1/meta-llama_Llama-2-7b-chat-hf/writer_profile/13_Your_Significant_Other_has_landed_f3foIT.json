    "story_prompt": "Your Significant Other has landed a book publishing deal! You're very proud of them, even if you don't actually enjoy their writing. One day, on a whim, you buy an actual copy in a book store. It's nothing like the pages they gave you to read. Nothing.",
    "output": "\nYou are sitting at home one evening, enjoying a quiet evening alone when you receive an unexpected phone call from your significant other. They're bursting with excitement and energy as they share the news that their book has finally been published! You're genuinely happy for them, even though you secretly dread the thought of having to read through the entire manuscript yourself. As they excitedly describe the contents of their novel, your mind begins to wander and imagine how it might be to read through such pages. Will they make sense? Will it flow well? And most importantly, will it be worth your time? \nDespite your reservations, you try to put on a good face and feign interest during their exuberant call. After all, supporting your partner is crucial. But deep down, you can't help but feel annoyed that they've wasted so much time working on this rather than focusing on their lucrative career in finance. It's almost like they don't know what they want or what will truly bring them happiness in life. \nDays pass, and your partner is overjoyed by their newfound success. They invite you to attend a book signing event and eagerly show off their work. The lines at the bookstore stretch around the block, and you wait patiently with the rest of the audience. When it's finally your turn, you purchase a copy and take it to the register. That's when something strange happens. Upon flipping through the pages, you realize it doesn't look anything like the pages they showed you earlier. Gone are the cringe-worthy puns and trite descriptions of sunsets you imagined during their phone call. In their place are beautiful, flowing paragraphs full of vivid imagery and compelling character arcs. You start to wonder if you were mistaken about the whole thing. Could it be that their passion project wasn't half-baked after all? As you continue to page through the book, you find yourself drawn into its fantastical world. \n\n\n"
