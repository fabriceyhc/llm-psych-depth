    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "    \nAs the days go by, your wife becomes more distant, lost in her own thoughts. You try to reach out to her, but she shuts down any conversation, insisting she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. The guilt you feel overwhelms you. You start to wonder if there\u2019s anything you could have done differently. Maybe if you had been more present during their childhood, things would be different now. The thought haunts you every day until you can\u2019t bear it anymore. \nYou sit at your desk staring at the same spot on the wall where the photo was once framed, wondering how things took such a tragic turn. The image of her little face still haunts you. Her smile and eyes are etched into your memory forever. You\u2019ll never forget those sparkling features or how much love you saw in her gaze.  \nYou know what\u2019s going on with your wife; she knows it too. The realization that she and her sister used to share this life-altering bond weighs on both of you, threatening to destroy everything. You can feel her pain in every interaction, the invisible scars of grief stretching across her face. You want nothing more than to take it all away, to reverse time, and keep her sister safe. The thought lingers in the back of your mind constantly, a persistent knot in your stomach.\nIn an effort to ease her suffering, you decide to do some investigating of your own. Gathering every bit of information, you try to piece together the events of that fateful night, hoping to shed some light on what really happened. But with each lead, the mystery only deepens, leaving you with more questions than answers. It feels like the further you dig, the more elusive the truth becomes. \nYou realize that the past cannot be undone, and the choices made long ago will always remain. The loss is irreparable, the pain of it unbearable. All you can do is hold on to memories, cherishing the brief moments of happiness your wife shared with her sister before the tragedy occurred. Those memories will have to be enough, and for better or worse, they\u2019ll be all you have left of the little girl in the photo.\n"
