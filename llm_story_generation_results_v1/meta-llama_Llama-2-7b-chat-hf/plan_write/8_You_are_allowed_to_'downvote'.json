    "story_prompt": "You are allowed to 'downvote' a government candidate instead of voting normally, reducing their votes by one. Turns out people have little love for politicians, and the majority end with negative votes. In these democracies, anonymity is the key to winning.",
    "characters": "\nSetting: A small town in a fictional country where this system exists. The citizens are fed up with corruption and poor governance, leading them to turn to this unconventional method of selecting leaders.\n\nCharacters:\n1) Alexei Petrov - Age 45, married with two kids. Works as a high school teacher. He has been actively participating in anti-government protests since last year's election scandal. Feeling frustrated and disillusioned with politics, he sees downvoting as his only chance at change. His wife doesn't share his enthusiasm, fearing it will lead to chaos and instability. Deep inside, he hopes that his vote might just be enough to bring about real reform.\n2) Elena Rodriguez - Age 28, single and working part-time as a freelance graphic designer. She's always felt marginalized by society due to her gender identity and sexual orientation. As she witnesses more and more candidates getting downvoted, she becomes increasingly desperate for someone who truly represents her community. Despite feeling powerless, she decides to take matters into her own hands by creating posters and flyers promoting positive messages of inclusivity and equality. Her actions inspire others around her, giving her hope for a brighter future.\n3) Viktor Kuznetsov - Age 60, retired from a long career as a factory worker. He's seen many political regimes come and go throughout his lifetime, growing tired of empty promises and broken trust. When he learns about downvoting, he feels like finally having some control over his destiny. With every passing day, he grows more determined to make sure his voice is heard above all the noise. Even if it means going against the grain or challenging authority, he won't back down until justice is served.",
    "output": "\nNote: This prompt is inspired by current events and societal issues, such as voter dissatisfaction with traditional political systems and movements towards greater representation and inclusion. It also touches upon deeper human emotions like hopelessness, empowerment, and the desire for meaningful change."
