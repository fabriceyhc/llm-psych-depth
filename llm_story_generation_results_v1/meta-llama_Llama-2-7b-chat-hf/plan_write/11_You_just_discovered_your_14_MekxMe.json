    "output": "\n---\nThe room was dimly lit when I entered, the only sound being the soft hum of the fireplace. My wife sat opposite me, her eyes fixed intently on my face. I could feel the weight of her gaze, like a physical force pressing down on my chest.\n\"You have to tell me what's going on,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Why did you keep this secret from us?\"\nI took a deep breath before speaking, choosing my words carefully. \"It's...complicated.\"\nShe shook her head, her expression unyielding. \"Don't lie to me. Your daughter is a Moon Princess, and we deserve to know why.\"\nMy heart raced as memories flooded back. The day I found the locket hidden away in the attic, the strange visions I had been experiencing since then. And now, here I was, facing the consequences of keeping such a massive secret from my loved ones.\n\"I didn't want to scare you,\" I admitted, feeling a pang of guilt. \"But the truth is, our daughter has incredible powers. She can transform into one of the world's greatest heroes, and her locket is a communication device too.\"\nMy wife's eyes widened in shock, her mouth hanging open slightly. \"How is that possible? Why haven't you told anyone?\"\nI hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. But something in her tone made me realize that she wasn't angry or upset; she genuinely wanted to understand. So I began to explain everything \u2013 the locket's origins, the Moon Goddess' blessings, and most importantly, the enormous responsibility that came with it.\nAs I spoke, I watched my wife process the information, her features softening gradually. When I finished, she reached across the table and took my hand.\n\"We'll support you and your daughter no matter what,\" she said, her voice full of conviction. \"Together, we will find a way to harness her powers for good.\"\nA wave of relief washed over me, followed closely by gratitude. This woman, my partner in every sense of the word, was giving me the benefit of the doubt despite having every reason not to trust me. And more than anything, I knew that together, we would overcome any obstacle standing in our way.\n\"Thank you,\" I whispered, tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. \"Thank you for understanding.\"\nShe smiled gently, her eyes sparkling with warmth. \"Of course, my love. That's what families do \u2013 stand by each other through thick and thin.\""
