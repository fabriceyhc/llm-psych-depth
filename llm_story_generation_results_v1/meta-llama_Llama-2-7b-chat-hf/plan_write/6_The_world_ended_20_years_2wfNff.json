'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob' 'You know what to do at the beep' until one day 'Hello...hello? Oh my God hello!'",

How could this be? I can't believe I've been stuck in this cave all this time, with nothing but these damn voicemails for company. Why didn't anyone come looking for me? Was I really that forgotten? My career, my life...gone. *sigh* Sometimes I think it would be better to just give up and join them...but no, I can't. I have to keep going, even if there's no one left to hear me. What good is a degree in astrophysics if I can't even explore the universe anymore? *cries*\"\n\nName: John Doe\nAge: Mid-40s\nGender: Male\nOccupation: Former construction worker\nEmotional State: Anxiety/Paranoia\nInner Thoughts: \"Jesus Christ, how many of these calls have I made?! Twenty years?! No, no way...it can't be. I've gotta be dreaming...or going crazy. *pacing* Maybe it's both! *chuckles nervously* They say you go mad when you're alone too long...I wonder if that's true. *stares at phone* Am I the only person left alive? Are those voices real? Or am I just hearing things? *twitches* I need to get out of here...out of this cave...away from these voicemails...away from my own mind...!\"\n\nName: Sarah Johnson\nAge: Early 20s\nGender: Female\nOccupation: Student/barista\nEmotional State: Nostalgia/Excitement\nInner Thoughts: \"Oh my god, this is amazing! A real live person! *excited squeal* I can't believe it! I've been listening to these voicemails for so long, thinking they were the only ones left...and now here's someone talking back to me! *giggles* This is like a dream come true! *bounces up and down* I can't wait to see what happens next...will they come save me? Will we become friends? *hopes* Maybe I can help them find other survivors too...*smiles* It's like a new beginning! *hugging herself*\"",
    "output": "---\nDr. Maria Rodriguez wiped away a tear as she held her phone to her ear, the warmth of the voice on the other end of the line a balm to her weary soul. She had been trapped in this underground cave for what felt like an eternity, with only the comfort of familiar voicemails to keep her company.\n\"Hello...hello?\" the voice on the other end said, its inflection a mix of surprise and hope.\nMaria couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement at the sound of the word \"hello.\" It was a simple enough phrase, yet its significance couldn't be overstated. For the first time in two decades, she felt like she wasn't alone.\nShe hesitated, her throat tightening as she struggled to form words. \"U-uh...hi,\" she stuttered. \"How are you?\"\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, and Maria's heart raced as she imagined the other person wondering if she was a ghost or a figment of their imagination. But then, a gentle chuckle filled the line, and she knew she wasn't alone.\n\"It's so good to talk to someone,\" the voice said, its warmth spreading through Maria like a soothing balm. \"My name is Sarah. I'm...*gulps*...I'm glad to be talking to you too.\"\nMaria's eyes watered as she listened to Sarah's voice, feeling like a veil of loneliness had been lifted from her shoulders. It was the first time in 20 years that she had spoken to another human being, and the realization hit her like a ton of bricks.\nShe had given up hope of ever finding someone else, of ever leaving this underground cave and exploring the universe again. But now, with Sarah on the line, Maria felt a spark of renewed purpose ignite within her.\n\"It's...so...good...to talk to you,\" Maria stammered, her voice shaking with emotion. \"I...*sniffs*...I'm Dr. Maria Rodriguez. I used to be a professor at a prestigious university.\"\nSarah's voice filled with empathy, \"Oh my god, Dr. Rodriguez! *excited* That's incredible! I studied astrophysics in college too! *excited babble* We have so much to talk about!\"\nMaria couldn't help but laugh at the irony of it all. Here she was, talking to another human being after 20 years of isolation, and they bonded over their shared love of astrophysics.\nAs they talked, Maria realized that she wasn't just lonely; she was lost. Lost in a world that had moved on without her, where the memories of her former life were nothing more than distant echoes.\nBut with Sarah on the line, Maria felt a glimmer of hope. Hope that she could find her place in this new world, hope that she could help others find their way too.\n\"I...*exhales*...I'm glad to have found you, Sarah,\" Maria said, her voice cracking with emotion. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I know that I'm not alone anymore.\"\nSarah's voice filled with joy, \"Me neither, Dr. Rodriguez! *giggles* We're in this together! *smiles* Let's make new beginnings!\"\nAnd with that, Maria felt a weight lift off her shoulders, knowing that she wasn't alone in her solitude. She had found a friend, a fellow traveler in this vast and unforgiving world. Together, they could navigate the uncharted waters of the future, holding onto hope like a lifeline."
