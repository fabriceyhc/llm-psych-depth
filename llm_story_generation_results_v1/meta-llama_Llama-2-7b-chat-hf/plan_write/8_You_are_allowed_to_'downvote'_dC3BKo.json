    "story_prompt": "You are allowed to 'downvote' a government candidate instead of voting normally, reducing their votes by one. Turns out people have little love for politicians, and the majority end with negative votes. In these democracies, anonymity is the key to winning.",
    "characters": "\nCharacter 1: John 'JD' Dunn. JD is a middle-aged businessman turned politician who has become increasingly jaded by the corruption and selfishness of his colleagues in the political arena. He believes in what he's doing, but is tired of being around the same types of people who don't share his vision. He downvotes candidates without much thought or consideration, as a way to cope with the cynicism he feels. Despite this, he still carries himself with a certain level of confidence and charisma, even if it's been dulled by the repetition of politics. Inner Thoughts: \"I never thought I'd end up like this. I was always passionate about making a difference, but now I just feel like a cog in a broken machine.\"\n\nCharacter 2: Dr. Maria Rodriguez. Dr. Rodriguez is a young and fiery academic who has made a name for herself in the field of political science. She believes in the power of direct democracy and has dedicated her career to studying and advocating for more participatory forms of governance. She enters the election as a dark horse candidate, using her reputation as an expert in the field to gain attention and support. Despite her enthusiasm and optimism, she's also aware of the challenges and limitations of the system, which makes her more cautious in her approach. Inner Thoughts: \"This is it. This is my chance to make a real difference. But I know the odds are against me. How can I possibly compete with all these established politicians?\"\n\nCharacter 3: Samuel 'Sam' Jackson. Sam is a former soldier turned activist who has spent years organizing protests and rallies against government corruption. He sees the election as an opportunity to finally bring about change from within the system, rather than through external means. Despite his strong convictions, he's also deeply empathetic and aware of the human element of politics. He's had to deal with the harsh realities of combat and knows that even the best intentions can go awry. Inner Thoughts: \"It's not going to be easy. But it has to be done. The current system is killing people, literally. I just hope I can do something to stop it.\"",
    "output": "\nIn a world where politicians were treated like royalty, John 'JD' Dunn couldn't help but feel disillusioned with the whole system. As a successful businessman turned government candidate, he had once been passionate about making a difference, but now he just felt like another cog in the machine. So when the option to downvote candidates became available, JD couldn't resist. He began clicking the button next to every candidate's name, a silent rebellion against the corruption and selfishness he saw all around him.\nAs the election drew nearer, JD found himself lost in thought, contemplating why things had gone so wrong. Had he been too trusting? Too idealistic? He shook his head, feeling like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of disappointment. That was when he met Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a young and fiery academic who had dedicated her career to studying and advocating for more participatory forms of governance. JD was immediately drawn to her enthusiasm and optimism, but also her awareness of the challenges and limitations of the system. They spoke for hours, sharing their frustrations and ideas for change. And in that moment, something shifted inside of JD. Maybe, just maybe, there was a way to effect change from within the system after all.\nMeanwhile, a young former soldier named Samuel 'Sam' Jackson was organizing protests and rallies against government corruption. He saw the election as an opportunity to finally bring about change from the outside in, but he also knew that the odds were against him. How could he possibly compete with all these established politicians? Still, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he had to try.\nThe election day arrived, and JD, Maria, and Sam stood at their respective polling stations, each with their own reasons for running. JD downvoted most of the candidates, still feeling disillusioned but also curious to see how things would play out. Maria used her reputation as an expert in political science to gain attention and support, while Sam appealed to the hearts and minds of the people, drawing on his experience as a soldier to connect with voters on a deeper level. And then came the results. The downvotes had reduced the tally of most candidates to near zero, catching everyone off guard. How could such a thing be possible? It was then that JD realized something profound - the only way to effect change was to listen to those who felt ignored, disenfranchised, or betrayed. Only then could he truly make a difference. And so he did something revolutionary - he embraced the anonymity of the downvotes, using them to amplify the voices of the marginalized and oppressed. And when the dust settled, it was clear that a new era of participatory governance had begun.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
