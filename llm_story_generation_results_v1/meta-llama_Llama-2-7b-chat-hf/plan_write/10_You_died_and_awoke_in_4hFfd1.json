    "output": "\nStory: Mary had always lived a good life, attending church every Sunday and trying to be kind to everyone she met. So when she died and awoke in Hell, she was shocked and terrified. How could this be? Wasn't she supposed to go to Heaven? But as she looked around at the other souls around her, she realized that she wasn't alone. There were others here too, all trapped in this place of eternal suffering.\nMary tried to find solace in her faith, but it didn't seem to matter. She was still here, surrounded by flames and pain. And then, one day, a figure appeared before her. Beelzebub, the demon who seemed to take pleasure in her suffering.\n\"So, you're new here,\" he said with a smirk. \"I see you're already familiar with the accommodations. You look...religious.\"\nMary glared at him, her eyes filled with anger and fear. \"This isn't what I expected. I thought I'd be in Heaven, not here.\"\nBeelzebub chuckled. \"Oh, you poor soul. You thought it was that easy? No, my dear, this is where you belong. You see, your good deeds weren't enough to get you into Heaven. You were selfish, and cruel, and didn't deserve to be there. So here you are, in the place where you truly belong.\"\nMary felt a tear roll down her cheek as she realized that this was true. She had never been completely selfless, had never really loved anyone except herself. And now she was paying the price for it.\nBut then, a different figure appeared before her. Azrael, the angel who served as the enforcer of God's will in Hell.\n\"Mary,\" he said gently. \"I know this is hard for you, but please understand that God is just. He sees everything, and He knows what you did. And even though you didn't deserve to be here, He still loves you. He wants you to find redemption, to learn from your mistakes and become better.\"\nMary looked up at him, her heart filled with hope. \"Is that possible? Can I really change?\"\nAzrael nodded. \"Of course. Anything is possible with God. But it won't be easy. You have to face your mistakes, and truly repent. It won't be comfortable, but it's worth it.\"\nMary took a deep breath, and nodded. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she was willing to try. And so began her journey towards redemption, in the darkest depths of Hell."
