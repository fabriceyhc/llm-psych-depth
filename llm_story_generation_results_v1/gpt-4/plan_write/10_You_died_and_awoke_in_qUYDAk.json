    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure. When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "characters": "Character 1: The Protagonist (John Smith)\n\nJohn Smith was an everyman during his life on Earth, laboring away in an advertising agency, dealing with stressful deadlines and demanding bosses. After dying, he awakened in a much more pleasant place - pristine, peaceful, and a stark contrast to his previous life. His emotions are a mix of confusion and relief. He is relieved to discover that the afterlife isn\u2019t void or filled with suffering, yet he is confused as to why this seemingly heavenly place is, in fact, hell. John's inner thoughts revolve around an attempt to unravel this mystery. He is open-minded, kind-hearted, and entirely puzzled by his paradoxical situation.\n\nCharacter 2: The Informant (Gabriel)\n\nGabriel is a former angel turned demon, stuck in Hell for ages unseen. He carries an air of resignation and fatigue, mixed with a strange form of acceptance. Despite his demonic status, he remains compassionate and kind. Gabriel is the one who informs John about their environment being, in fact, Hell. His emotions are full of weariness and a somber sort of amusement at John's confusion. Gabriel's inner thoughts are filled with conflicting feelings of frustration at being trapped in Hell and a mysterious satisfaction, at watching newcomers come to terms with their paradoxical situation. He is reserved and introverted, still carrying a sense of his once angelic nature.\n\nCharacter 3: The Concerned Demon (Morpheus)\n\nMorpheus is the demon assigned to introduce John to Hell. He is deep down, a well-meaning entity, despite his intimidating appearance and title as a demon. Morpheus is in a state of heightened concern at John's lack of distress over his situation. In his mind, it goes against everything he knows about humans' reaction to being told they're in Hell. Morpheus' inner thoughts involve worry and confusion towards John's calm demeanor. While he shows signs of agitation, lineaments of empathy and curiosity shine through. Morpheus is a serious and diligent worker, baffled by the new human\u2019s serenity, and is paradoxically concerned about his lack of concern.",
    "output": "John Smith opened his eyes to a realm of pastel colors and genteel tranquility. The surroundings were much nicer than his tiny apartment back in the gritty city he had left behind. Whispers of serene aspen trees, punctuated by the occasional laughter drifted towards him on a gentle breeze. This was far from his daily grind of stressful deadlines and relentless bosses. \n\nHe chuckled to himself, \"If this is the afterlife, I should've died earlier.\"\n\nA presence interrupted his thoughts. A creature, frail and wearied beyond his age yet radiating a strange kind of peace, approach him. \"Hello John, I'm Gabriel. Welcome to...hell.\"\n\nJohn blinked, taken aback. \"Hell?\" He laughed, looking around at their surroundings, \"You must be joking.\"\n\nGabriel shook his head, a sardonic smile playing on his lips. \n\nBefore he could argue further, a third figure made its appearance. His dark cloak concealed most of him, but under the hood two crimson eyes glowed with concern.\n\n\"John Smith,\" the figure spoke, his voice a soothing baritone. \"I'm Morpheus, your assigned guide. We've been informed of your... calm reaction to your situation.\"\n\nCalming down from his initial laughter, John furrowed his brows \"Should I panic then, in this place of peace?\"\n\nMorpheus faltered. His millennia-old script regarding fear, repentance, and despair did not prepare him for John's tranquility.\n\nUndeterred, John plowed on, \"I have a question actually. If this is Hell, then where is all the suffering, torment?\"\n\n\"Oh, they are here John,\" Gabriel responded, \"For Hell mirrors the heart. It's designed to amplify one's deepest fears, regrets, and resentments. For some, it is a place of torment, and for others...it seems it can be paradise.\"\n\nWith that, John was left alone. As the sun set, painting the sky a brilliant amethyst, John watched the inhabitants. They weren't demons or grotesque monsters. They were ordinary people like him, gathered, laughing, and conversing with each other. They seemed...happy.\n\nJohn pondered over Gabriel's words, understanding dawned upon him. Indeed, this was hell. He'd ended up in a place detached from earthly desires, challenges, and the friction needed for growth. His life had been hard, but those hardships defined him. In its absence, he felt a disconcerting hollowness. Here, in this peaceful eternity, there would be no aspirations, no achievements, no failure, and thus, no true living.\n\nJohn thought back to the demanding bosses, the frustrating peers, the exhausting days in the office full of persisting in the face of adversity. For the first time, he recognized the beauty within the struggle, the courage within the chaos. \n\nThis realisation, though unsettling, began seeping into him. John began to see hell for what it was. A realm far removed from the pain of the real world, yes, but equally distant from its glory, its tenacity, its very essence. \n\nIt was then that John felt a pang of longing, not for heaven or for this tranquil Hell but for life, messy, chaotic, beautiful life on Earth. The afterlife was no match for it. In his chest, something tightened, and for the first time since he arrived, John Smith felt a deep pain of loss. For he might be in Hell or heaven, but he was no longer amongst the living."
