    "story_prompt": "You are severely depressed and are given a service dog to help you through it. However, due to a mixup, you are given a dog that is actually much more depressed than you. The main thing that gets you up in the morning is knowing that you need to be the service human for your dog.",
    "output": "The morning sun pierced the narrow slits of the blinds, casting lively patterns on the worn-out wallpaper. Andrew stared at the ceaseless dance of light and shadow, hoping to leech strength from it. Depression, like a mischievous shadow, had haunted him for years, and in a bid to combat this relentless monster, he was given a gift of companionship - a service dog, or so he thought. \n\nBut as fate would have it, he got Scout, a golden retriever with melancholy etched in his sorrowful brown eyes. Scout was a vision of paradox, a bundle of paradoxical charisma, spiritedly confined within the ramparts of his invisible suffering.

The desperate need to drag himself out of the abyss of depression no longer stemmed from his own survival instinct but out of necessity for Scout. He started to symbolize the very embodiment of his struggle, and in serving Scout, Andrew was vicariously serving himself. A sense of purpose began to refill the void that depression had hollowed out within him.\n\nHe initiated minor changes - he began his mornings with coaxing Scout out for walks.
