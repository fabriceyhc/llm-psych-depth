    "output": "In all its millennia of life \u2013 a concept as alien to it as its mere existence was to humans \u2013 it had never encountered nightmares. \n\nThe creature, who from its own tongue might be named Hagion, came from a world where it was nourished by dreams; intangible stories of desire, hope and quiet surrender of the subconscious. It travelled the cosmos, reveling in the dreamscapes spun by sentient species in distant galaxies, the light from their stars as much a diet for its existence as the dreams encrypted within sentient minds. \n\nWhen Hagion basked under new stars, its translucent body shimmered with colors unseen by human eyes and absorbed invisible flavours of dreams that spun within its being like a spell. It had tasted dreams of glory from the warriors of Penum'dara, dreams of intricate beauty from the artisans of Siyliss and dreams of infinite love from the harmonious union of Trillan'bor. Yet, it had not experienced dreams of dread until it came upon Earth.\n\nIt was the terrors of the human mind that brought an unfamiliar sensation to Hagion. These were not the gentle, beautiful, inspiring dreams on which it thrived; but frantic visions filled with fear, sorrow, regret and guilt. Nightmarish apparitions that it had never tasted in any conscious gallery anywhere in the cosmic expanse. Humans, paradoxically fragile and resilient creatures, brought an unknown and disconcerting element to its ethereal diet.\n\nThe alien seeped into the nightmares of a sleep-tormented little girl, trouble etched on her cherub face. She dreamt of losing her parents in the midst of an unidentifiable crowd, hands reaching out in vain. Through her fear, Hagion tasted human love, frailty, a deep sense of loss. A visceral, piercing feeling that was as disquieting as it was profound.\n\nIt tapped into the dreams of a guilt-ridden soldier who lived not the valor, but the horrors of war. Images of blood and puddled faces of lost companions laden with accusations. This dream carried an intensity of remorse, self-incrimination, a haunting solitude that sent tremors through Hagion's cosmic being.\n\nThe alien drank of the nightmares of a lonely old man, age also a peculiarly human characteristic. Fears of insignificance, forgotten existence, regret branded in each fading heartbeat. Hagion was overwhelmed by a drowning sorrow, an all-encompassing existential dread.\n\nEach nightmare was an intimate dance with darkness. Yet within this darkness wasn't just fear. Woven within were raw and powerful emotions \u2013 love, courage, desire, regret, guilt, sorrow. It tasted the deeply private, deeply complex universe within each human. The clash of inner light and darkness remarkably resonating with the cosmic dance of stars and black holes, making Hagion realize; humans were not just the first, but likely the only sentients in the galaxy that possessed such intricate, painful, yet beautiful dreams.\n\nIt left Earth, carrying the exceptional human ability to dream in ecstasy and agony both. From a planet that gifted it a rich tapestry of dreams unlike any other, Hagion was left eternally changed, carrying with it the taste of humanity embedded in its cosmic existence, forever."
