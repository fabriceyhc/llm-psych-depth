    "output": "John wasn\u2019t prepared for the storm that whirlwinded into his life when Lila was murdered. It was just three months after their wedding. To his surprise, he discovered his wife had an estranged sibling - Lila, a sister he'd never met. The bleak news of her murder came like a cold gust of wind, shaking the foundations of their newly built life together. \n\nHis wife, Lisa, a web of enigmatic charm and layered secrets, had been acting strangely since the incident. Her eyes were steeped in an inexplicable restlessness. Her laughter, once a bubbling brook of joy, had turned into an occasional ripple that looked more forced than genuine. She'd steal away to the attic frequently, probably seeking solace in the loneliness, marooned in the vivid gallery of their family's taped past.\n\nOne day, attempting to understand her unusual behaviour, John found himself rummaging through the attic. Amid dust-covered trinkets and withered books, he found an old family photo tucked away in a corner. He carefully unfolded it, curiosity and apprehension making his hands tremble. It was a picture of Lisa and Lila, young, rosy-cheeked, their infectious laughter caught in a frame forever. Two identical smiles, two identical pairs of vibrant hazel eyes, the same cascade of chocolate brown hair. \n\nThey weren't just sisters; they were twins. The realisation hit him like a thunderbolt, delivering a shiver that cut through his warm skin down to the bone.\n\nThe uncanny resemblance was unsettling. Memories of his wife began to flicker where Lila had been, her visage so firmly etched in Lisa\u2019s behavior that he couldn\u2019t tell where his wife ended, and her sister began. He felt a pang of profound sadness for his wife \u2013 her twin\u2019s death was not just a loss, it was a brutal severance of a part of her very own being.\n\nFeeling the sharp sting of betrayal, he was angered at Lisa for withholding this prominent part of her life. But as he looked at the photo, those identical smiling faces helped his resentment subside. He realized the grief that clung to her was not just for an estranged sister, but for a 'twin', a mirror of herself.\n\nJohn descended from the attic, the old photo pressed firmly in his hand. His perception of his wife's behaviour had pivoted entirely. Her sorrowful eyes were no longer a mystery to him; her solitude was not strange anymore. \n\nAs he entered their shared bedroom, he saw Lisa soaked in the moonlight that filtered through the windows. Her tear streaked face, often mistaken for a manifestation of melancholy, was now a testament to her courage. \n\nWith newfound understanding, John held Lisa tighter than ever before \u2013 an embrace that screamed apology, acceptance and the promise of shouldering her grief together. For he now realised that every tear she spilled, every moment of silence, every pang of loss was an echo of a severed connection, a mirror shattered, a twin lost into oblivion. \n\nJohn mixed up a recipe of hope and resilience, as they embarked on a beautiful and healing journey of navigating through the sea of emotions, grief and recovery together. After all, he loved two women now: his wife Lisa, and the ghostly memory of her twin forever etched in her sorrowful eyes - Lila."
