    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "Chilled winds whispered as I sifted through our dusty attic, searching among unexplored relics from my wife Rebecca\u2019s past. She\u2019d never been one for nostalgia, her life taking a bitter turn when her estranged sister, Justine, was brutally murdered, just after our newlywed vows. My heart ached watching Rebecca sway between grief-stricken days and unsettlingly odd behaviours. But I attributed her actions to her loss. \n\nAmid the boxes of forgotten mementoes, I spied an old photo album. The brittle pages painted a captivating tableau of a young Rebecca, ferreted away in her paternal brown eyes laden with innocence. What stirred my nerves was the mirror image beside her\u2014a girl identical in every aspect. \n\nThey were twins.\n\nJustine wasn't just Rebecca's sister; they were two halves of the same soul. It was a revelation that made my heart constrict as the strange behaviour of Rebecca slowly peeled layers to a disturbing truth.\n\nHer vacant stares, the speaking in hushed tones during midnight, secrets escaping her raspberry lips into the silent echoes of the night. I connected the dots. The odd persona of Rebecca was perhaps not grief but an untamed manifestation of Justine\u2019s presence.\n\nIn countless chilly nights, I found her at the window, gazing at the moonlit yard, a chilling emptiness reflecting off her glassy eyes. It was as if Justine\u2019s ghost lived through Rebecca. The idea sent shivers down my spine, but it explained her withdrawn disposition, the eerie silence that followed every attempt of my consolation.\n\nI grieved for Justine, but more so for Rebecca. For the unprecedented torment mustered by the mysterious entanglement of being divinely joined yet tragically separated. Rebecca was traumatized, and our domestic tranquility lay shattered, my once vibrant wife sunk deep within the abyss of irretrievable despair.\n\nI chose to confront her.\n\nThe soft glow of twilight cast anguished shadows across Rebecca\u2019s face as her wet eyes mirrored my concern. When I placed the photo in front of her, she trembled, her once rosy cheeks bereft of colour as the truth sewed itself into my words.\n\nJustine was more than her sister; Justine was a part of her, torn away ruthlessly, leaving Rebecca bereft of her other half. She confessed her quiet conversations in the dead of night were aimed at a presence only she could feel, a connection only she could perceive. \n\nMy heart shattered\u2014in our shared pain, there was also shared understanding. Compassion bloomed in my chest, replacing the anxiety with tenderness and a newfound strength to support Rebecca through her internal torment. I vowed to navigate her through her grief, to strive to restore the woman I fell in love with, the woman whose half was torn away. \n\nUnder the veil of the night, I held Rebecca close, whispering comforting words against her hair, allowing the silence to echo our shared understanding. Together, we were drenched in sharing not just a pain, but an alliance to help Rebecca reclaim her life from the vice-grip of her twin's tragic departure."
