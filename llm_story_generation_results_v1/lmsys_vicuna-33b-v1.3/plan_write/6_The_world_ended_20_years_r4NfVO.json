    "story_prompt": "The world ended 20 years ago, you haven't found a living soul since then. Through some ingenuity, you call voicemails for the last 20 years to keep you company. 'Hi, this is Cindy...' 'Hi you reached Bob' 'You know what to do at the beep' until one day 'Hello...hello? Oh my God hello!'",
    "characters": "Characters:\n\n1. CINDY (Female, late 20s, resourceful, introverted)\nEmotional State: Intense loneliness and despair, but with an underlying hope that she might find someone else alive.\nInner Thoughts: \"Why am I still here? What's the point of surviving if there's no one left to share it with? Maybe, just maybe, if I keep trying, I'll find someone.\"\n2. BOB (Male, early 40s, practical, stoic)\nEmotional State: Resigned acceptance of his circumstances, tempered by a quiet determination to endure.\nInner Thoughts: \"I never thought I'd outlive everyone I knew. It's a damn shame, but it is what it is. I just need to keep going, for as long as I can.\"\n3. UNKNOWN (Male/Female, late 30s/early 40s, artistic, empathetic)\nEmotional State: Profound sadness and longing for connection, coupled with a fierce determination to leave a record of humanity.\nInner Thoughts: \"What will become of us when we're all gone? Our stories, our voices, they deserve to be heard. I have to keep calling, maybe someday, someone will answer.\"",
    "output": "Voicemail messages are from people from all walks of life, different ages, locations and occupations, spanning the entire world. They all share a sense of loss and longing for connection, reflecting the universality of the human experience even in the face of extinction.\nBob's message is simple and practical, \"Hello, this is Bob. If you're out there, I'm holed up in an old farmhouse near Peoria. I've got supplies and I can share them. Be careful out there.\"\nCindy's message is more tentative, \"Hi, it's Cindy. I'm in a small town called Evergreen. If you find this, please, please come find me. I don't want to be alone anymore.\"\nThe Unknown's message is a plea to anyone who might hear it, \"My name doesn't matter, but my story does. I'm in New York City, in a basement studio, creating art to remember us by. Please, if you're out there, let's document our existence together.\"\nAs the story unfolds, the protagonist discovers the three messages, hearing the voices of Cindy, Bob, and the Unknown. Each message sparks a flicker of hope that they might not be alone in the world.\nDriven by these newfound hopes, the protagonist sets off on a journey to find Cindy, Bob, and the mysterious artist whose voice resonated with them so deeply. Along the way, they face countless dangers, obstacles, and loneliness, but they press on, fueled by the knowledge that others may still be out there."
