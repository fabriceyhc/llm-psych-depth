She knew that first impressions were important, so she grasped the hand tightly, hoping to establish dominance.\n\nEmma's heart raced as she tried to make sense of the situation. She had always been fascinated by the unknown, but now she was facing it head-on, and she wasn't sure if she was ready for this challenge.

Emma learned to face her fears and confront the unknown, while James and Lila used their skills and knowledge to protect her and uncover the truth.\n\nAs they unraveled the dark secrets buried within the walls of the mansion, they discovered that the entity was once a human \u2013 a troubled soul who had become trapped between"
