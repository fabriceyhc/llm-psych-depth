The radio had been silent for years, the once constant stream of news and music replaced with the deafening silence of a planet void of humanity.\n\nIn my solitude, I found comfort in the most unlikely of places \u2013 old voicemails. I spent hours listening to the automated greetings and the dulcet tones of friends and strangers alike, each message a window into a world that no longer existed.\n\n\"Hi, this is Cindy. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you soon.\"\n\n\"Hi, you've reached Bob. Feel free to leave a message, buddy.\"\n\n\"You know what to do at the beep. Don't hesitate, just leave it.\"\n\nDay after day, I listened to these messages, the voices of ghosts from a past long gone. It was both haunting and oddly soothing, a reminder of what once was and what could never be again.\n\nAnd then, one day, everything changed. As I sat in my shelter, the old walkie-talkie crackled to life. A voice, weak and strained, echoed through the static.\n\n\"Hello...hello? Oh my God, hello!\"\n\nI stared at the device, disbelief flooding through me. It had been so long since I'd heard another human voice that the sound struck me like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\"I'm here! I'm here!\" I cried into the radio, my words tumbling out in a desperate rush. \"Don't go, please! I'm all alone!\"\n\nThe response was hesitant, the voice thin and trembling. \"I...I don't know if I can trust this, but I'm here too. My name is Sarah. What's yours?\"\n\nI struggled to find the words, my heart pounding in my chest. \"My name is Alex. It's so good to hear another person. How have you survived all this time?\"\n\nThere was a pause before Sarah replied, her voice filled with sadness. \"I don't know how much longer I can last. I've been hiding, waiting for something, anything to change. But it never does.\"\n\nOur conversation was hesitant, cautious, as if we were both afraid that the other was a figment of our imaginations. We shared our stories, the horrors we had endured, and the isolation that had become our constant companion.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, our connection grew stronger. We spoke of the life we had both known, sharing our memories and the stories of those we had lost. In each other, we found a piece of the world we had left behind.\n\nBut the shadows of our past continued to loom over us. Our newfound bond was a fragile thing, and we both knew that it could be snuffed out in an instant.\n\nOne day, as we spoke of the families we had once had, the tears fell freely down my cheeks. \"I miss them so much,\" I whispered into the radio. \"I just want to see them again.\"\n\nSarah's voice cracked as she responded. \"I know, Alex. I miss mine too. It's so hard to believe they're really gone.\"\n\nIn the silence that followed, I couldn't help but think of the years that had passed since the world ended. Twenty years of isolation and loneliness, with no end in sight. And yet, despite it all, we had found each other.\n\nAs I laid down to sleep that night, I held onto the hope that Sarah and I could make it through whatever the world threw at us. Together, we would face whatever came next, our voices guiding us through the darkness.\n\nFor now, that was enough.\n```"
