    "story_prompt": "You wake up in the middle of the night, your arm hangs over the side of your bed. It\u2019s pitch black & your room is shrouded in deep shadow. Something unseen seizes your hand. You grasp it tightly, knowing that first impressions are important & a firm, confident handshake establishes dominance.",
    "output": "The thing that seized your hand is cold & wet, it doesn't let go, it pulls. You are now out of bed, still clutching this creature\u2019s hand. The room seems brighter now. You see it is covered in thick slime & its skin is translucent. It appears to be a water creature.\nYou ask \"Why did you wake me up?\" It speaks with a distinctly human voice \"I need your help\" it says. You respond \"with a grip this strong you could be a hand model or an orthopedic surgeon\". You both laugh, the tension broken.\n\nYou learn that it\u2019s from a parallel world where everything is the opposite, where people are poor & rich people are slaves. Where beautiful people are ugly & vice versa. You are hesitant but curious. You agree to help it as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. It agrees & you both shake hands again.\n\nAs you travel through portals between worlds, it shows you its world. People living in cardboard boxes, police arresting those with nice clothes, hospitals filled with sick rich people & healthy poor people being denied treatment. The contrast is striking.\nIt shows you the leader of the opposition, a woman who wants to change things. She\u2019s been captured & locked away. You devise a plan to rescue her, using your wits & the creatures strength.\n\nTogether you break her out, and as the three of you run through the streets, you realize how much you\u2019ve come to care for this creature. You didn\u2019t think you could love something so different, but you do.\n\nWith the leader free, they begin the fight for equality. You and the creature stay together, fighting for what\u2019s right in both worlds. Your bond grows stronger, and you realize that love can transcend differences & save entire worlds.\nIn the end, you\u2019re glad you answered that late-night knock at the door."
