They play this game as an escape, but end up finding community and friendship through it.\nThe twist comes when they meet another player who knows their secret identity and tells them they were once a vampire hunter, but then got turned by the vampire's sire (parent) years ago. This person had been searching for the vampire ever since, wanting to either kill them or get them to turn them back into a human.\nHowever, the vampire and the player form a connection through the game, leading to the vampire questioning everything they thought they knew about their life and their existence.\nIn the end, they decide to help the other player get their mortality back and in return, the player helps the vampire to learn how to live in peace with their nature and find a new sense of purpose.\nThe story revolves around the concept of identity, escapism, and finding acceptance and belonging."
