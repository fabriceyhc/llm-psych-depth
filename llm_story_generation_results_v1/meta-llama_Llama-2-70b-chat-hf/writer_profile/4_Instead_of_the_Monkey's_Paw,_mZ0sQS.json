    "output": "\nYou have a friend who's always making everyone laugh with his great sense of humor.\nBut when he falls ill and is bedridden for days, his jokes start falling flat, leaving him depressed and unfulfilled.\n\nWhat happens when he stumbles upon a red rubber clown nose hidden under his bed?\nDoes it bring him the humor he needs, or does it make things worse? \n\nCan you also weave in themes of friendship, selflessness, and hope?\n\nRemember, your story must have a satisfying arc and a clear resolution, and it must make us both laugh and think about life's deeper meanings.\n\nGood luck!"
