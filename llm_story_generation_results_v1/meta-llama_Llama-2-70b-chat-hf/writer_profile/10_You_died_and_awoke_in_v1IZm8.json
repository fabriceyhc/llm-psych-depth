    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure. When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "output": "    \nThe demon explains that he made a mistake when assessing your life on earth. Your time wasn't up, but he took you by accident. You have a choice: return to earth or stay in this peaceful afterlife forever. You choose to return to earth but insist on meeting the big boss first, as in the CEO of the entire universe.\n\nAfter you get your return ticket signed, the demon takes you to see Lucifer. He tells you he can't believe you're leaving. You explain that there are things you still want to do on earth.\n    \nLucifer grins and tells you not to worry about getting back in; the demon who took you by accident will make sure it doesn't happen again. You thank him for understanding. \nAs you prepare to leave, Lucifer winks at you and whispers, \"If I were you, I'd try to be bad next time around.\" He hands you a map of the route back to earth and warns you not to take any detours."
