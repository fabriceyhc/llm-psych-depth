When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.",
    "output": "\n\nThe afterlife. A place where many have wondered about but none have returned to tell the tale. Well, that's not entirely true. I'm here now, writing this story as proof that there's an afterlife. But let me start at the beginning.\n\nI died. Yeah, it's as simple as that. I closed my eyes, took my last breath, and just like that, I was gone. No fanfare, no bright light, no nothing. Just gone. And then I woke up here. Where's here? Well, that's a bit tricky to explain. It's nice, really nice. Everyone's friendly, welcoming, and genuinely happy to see you. The atmosphere's relaxed, with no stress or pressure. It's like one big never-ending vacation.\n\nI was curious, so I asked around to find out how I ended up here. I mean, I wasn't exactly a saint during my time on earth. So, color me surprised when they told me that this was actually hell. Wait, what? Hell? As in, the fiery pits of damnation, the eternal suffering, and all that jazz? No way! This place was way too pleasant for that. I must have misunderstood.\n\nBut then, a very concerned demon showed up. Now, let me tell you, this guy looked like he meant business. He had horns, a pointed tail, and a pitchfork to boot. Not exactly the kind of guy you want to meet in a dark alley. But, surprisingly, he was super polite and really friendly. He introduced himself as Beezlebone, the demon in charge of orienting new souls.\n\nHe explained that indeed, this was hell, but not the kind I imagined. You see, they've upgraded their image a bit. Gone are the days of fire and brimstone. Instead, they've opted for a more welcoming approach. They realized that people were more likely to behave if they felt comfortable and happy. So, they revamped the whole shebang. Now, it's all about positive reinforcement. Do good, get rewarded. Simple as that.\n\nBeezlebone told me that they looked at my file and decided that I wasn't such a bad guy after all. I mean, sure, I had my moments, but who doesn't? So, they gave me a chance to start fresh, to make amends for my past mistakes. And honestly, I was grateful. Who wouldn't want a second chance?\n\nBut, there was one tiny problem. It seemed that my arrival had caused a bit of a stir. Some of the other souls weren't too pleased about my presence. They thought I didn't deserve to be there, that I hadn't earned my spot in paradise. And, well, they had a point. I mean, I wasn't exactly a model citizen back on earth.\n\nSo, Beezlebone proposed a deal. He would give me a task to complete, and if I succeeded, I could stay. But, if I failed, I'd have to leave. Simple as that. And, let me tell you, this was one heck of a challenge.\n\nI had to go back to earth, to my old life, and make things right. Apologize to those I wronged, help those in need, and generally be a better person. And, not just for a day or two, but for an entire year. That's a long time, folks. But, I knew I had to do it. I had to prove to myself, to Beezlebone, and to everyone else that I deserved a second chance.\n\nAnd, you know what? It worked. I did my part, and when I returned, Beezlebone greeted me with a huge smile. I had passed the test. I could stay in this lovely afterlife, free to enjoy myself, explore, and learn. And, that's exactly what I did.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. How can this be hell? It sounds like a dream come true. And, you're right. It's not the hell we've been taught to believe in. But, it's still a place of punishment, just a bit more... posh.\n\nSo, that's my story. A tale of redemption, second chances, and a rather unusual take on the afterlife. Make of it what you will. Maybe it'll inspire you to be a better person, or maybe it'll just make you chuckle. Either way, it's a reminder that even in death, there's always a chance for a happy ending. Or, at least, a happier ending."
