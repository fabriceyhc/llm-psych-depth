    "output": "\nHow do you respond when they find out?\n\n(Please use proper grammar and spelling, as if this were a professional submission)\n\nDear Writer,\n\nI'm thrilled to hear about your publishing deal! It's a dream come true, and I'm so proud of you for pursuing your passion. I've always been a fan of your work, even if I don't necessarily enjoy every aspect of it. But that's the beauty of art - it's subjective, and what speaks to one person might not resonate with another.\n\nWhen I heard the news, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of your book. I wanted to hold it in my hands, feel the weight of your words, and flip through the pages. So, on a whim, I stopped by a bookstore and picked up a copy.\n\nAs I started reading, I was taken aback. The words on those pages were not the ones I had read before. The style was different, the tone was different, and the story itself was unfamiliar. I felt like I had been transported to a different world, one that was foreign and unexpected.\n\nAt first, I was confused. I thought to myself, \"Is this really the same person who wrote those beautiful, heart-wrenching stories I've read before?\" But as I continued to read, something unexpected happened. I found myself getting lost in the narrative, drawn into the world you had created. The characters came alive, their struggles and triumphs becoming my own. I laughed, I cried, and I felt everything in between.\n\nIt was then that I realized that your talent goes beyond just writing. You have a gift for storytelling, for weaving together words that create a tapestry of emotions and experiences. Your writing touches people's hearts, makes them think, and challenges their perspectives. And that, my dear, is truly special.\n\nSo, how do I respond when you find out that I bought a copy of your book? With honesty, of course. I'll tell you how much I admire your work, how proud I am of your accomplishments, and how grateful I am to be able to share in this journey with you.\n\nI know that not everyone will appreciate your writing in the same way that I do. But that's okay. Art is subjective, and what matters most is that your work speaks to those who need it. You have a gift, my love, and I'm so lucky to be able to witness it firsthand.\n\nWith all my love and support,\n\n[Your Name]"
