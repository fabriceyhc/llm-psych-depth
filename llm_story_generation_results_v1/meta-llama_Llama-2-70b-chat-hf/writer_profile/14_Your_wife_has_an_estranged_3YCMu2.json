    "story_prompt": "Your wife has an estranged sister that you have never met. She was murdered in a cold case soon after you were married. You brush off your wife\u2019s new strange behaviour after the murder as grief. Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise\u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
    "output": "Your wife had a twin that died and she didn\u2019t tell you about it until now, years later?\nWhat do you do? What are your thoughts? Do you confront her about it? How does it make you feel?\n\nI don't know what to do. My mind is a mess of emotions, confusion, and questions. My wife has always been secretive about her past, but this? This is something else entirely. Why would she keep such a huge secret from me? What else has she been hiding?\nI'm angry, but mostly I'm hurt. We've been married for over a decade, and I thought we had a good thing going. But now, it seems like everything is built on lies.\n\nI remember when we first met, she was always a bit reserved when it came to talking about her family. I didn't think much of it at the time, assuming that she just didn't want to dwell on painful memories. Now, I realize that there was so much more to it.\n\nThe photo I found was old, probably taken when my wife was just a kid. In it, she's standing next to a girl who looks exactly like her. They're both smiling, arms around each other, clearly happy. It's like looking at a before and after picture of the same person. My heart aches for my wife, knowing that she lost her twin so young.\n\nBut why did she never tell me? Was she ashamed? Did she think I wouldn't understand? I wish she had trusted me enough to share this with me. Now, I feel like I don't even know the woman I'm married to.\n\nMy mind races with all the possible scenarios. Maybe she was scared of losing me if I knew the truth. Perhaps she wanted to protect me from the pain of her past. Or could it be that she simply didn't know how to bring it up, afraid of reliving the trauma?\n\nI don't know what to do. Part of me wants to confront her, to demand answers and explanations. But another part of me is terrified of pushing her away. What if she can't handle the truth? What if she leaves me?\n\nAll these thoughts swirl in my head, making me dizzy and disoriented. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my own home, scared of saying or doing the wrong thing.\n\nDays pass, and I still haven't brought it up. I'm hoping that she'll come to me, that she'll finally open up and explain everything. But she doesn't. Instead, she continues to act strangely, sometimes staring off into space, lost in thought. It's like she's carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.\n\nOne night, I come home from work and find her sitting in the dark, staring at that old family photo. I know I can't keep quiet any longer.\n\n\"Hey,\" I say softly, sitting beside her. \"We need to talk.\"\n\nShe looks up at me, and for a moment, I see the fear and vulnerability in her eyes. Then, she takes a deep breath and starts to speak.\n\n\"I didn't want to tell you because I was scared,\" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Scared of losing you, of being judged, of reliving it all. My twin, Sarah, was murdered when we were kids. It was a cold case, and they never caught the guy. I didn't know how to tell you, how to explain it without making you feel like I'm damaged goods.\"\n\nI take her hand, feeling a lump form in my throat. \"I'm so sorry. My God, why didn't you tell me earlier?\"\n\nShe shrugs. \"I don't know. Fear, I guess. Fear of losing you, of being rejected. I thought you wouldn't understand, that you'd think I'm broken or something.\"\n\nI pull her into a hug, holding her tightly. \"You're not broken, you're strong. And I love you, no matter what. We'll face this together, okay?\"\n\nShe nods, tears streaming down her face. \"Thank you. I'm so sorry for not trusting you earlier.\"\n\nAs we sit there in the dim light, surrounded by the ghosts of her past, I realize that our marriage isn't built on lies. It's built on love, understanding, and acceptance. We may have our flaws and secrets, but at the end of the day, we're willing to face them together."
