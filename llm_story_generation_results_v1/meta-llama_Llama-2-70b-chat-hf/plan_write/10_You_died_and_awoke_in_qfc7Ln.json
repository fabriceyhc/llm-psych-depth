    "story_prompt": "You died and awoke in the afterlife. It's quite nice actually. The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure.

    "characters": "\nDemon: The first character is the demon who visits the human upon their arrival in the afterlife. The demon, named Beezlebat, appears to be cheerful, enthusiastic, and friendly, but beneath the surface, they are anxious and worried about the human's presence in hell. They wonder if they have made a mistake in bringing the human to the afterlife and fear the consequences of their actions.\n\nHuman: The second character is the human who has died and arrived in the afterlife. They are initially confused, surprised, and skeptical about their surroundings, but as they begin to understand that they are indeed in hell, they become frightened and anxious. They worry about what will happen to them and whether they will be able to escape.\n\nAngel: The third character is an angel named Raphael who works in the afterlife's administration department. They are responsible for reviewing the human's file and determining whether they belong in heaven or hell. Raphael appears to be stoic and unemotional, but they are secretly conflicted about the human's fate. They wonder if they have made a mistake in sending the human to hell and feel a sense of responsibility for their well-being.\n\nThe demon and the angel both struggle with their own moral compasses and the ethics of their roles in the afterlife, while the human is caught in the middle, trying to navigate their new surroundings and make sense of their situation.",
