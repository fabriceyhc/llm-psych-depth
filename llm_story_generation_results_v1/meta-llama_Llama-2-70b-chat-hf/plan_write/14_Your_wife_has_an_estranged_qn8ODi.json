    "output": "\nI stared at the old family photo in my hand, my mind racing with disbelief. My wife, who I had been married to for over a decade, had a twin sister? It couldn't be true. And yet, there they were, standing side by side, two little girls with the same mischievous grin and sparkling eyes.\n\nI felt a knot in my stomach as I thought about all the times my wife had mentioned her \"dead\" sister. I had always assumed it was a tragic accident or illness that had taken her life. But now, I wasn't so sure.\n\nMy wife had been acting strange lately. She would often disappear for hours at a time, claiming she needed space. And when she returned, she seemed distant, lost in thought. I had brushed it off as grief, but now I wondered if there was more to it.\n\nI decided to confront her, to ask her about the twin sister she had never talked about before. I found her in our bedroom, staring out the window.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said softly, trying not to startle her. \"Can we talk?\"\n\nShe turned to me, her eyes cloudy and guarded. \"What is it?\"\n\nI held out the photo, my heart pounding. \"Who is this?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHer face drained of color as she took the photo from me. \"Where did you find this?\" she demanded, her voice sharp.\n\n\"In an old family album,\" I replied, my palms sweating. \"Why didn't you ever tell me about your twin sister?\"\n\nShe sighed, her shoulders slumping. \"I didn't want to talk about it. It's too painful.\"\n\nI stepped closer, my heart aching for her. \"Tell me,\" I urged gently. \"I want to understand.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then began to speak. \"Her name was Sarah. We were inseparable growing up. But as we got older, we started to drift apart. She started hanging out with the wrong crowd, getting into trouble. I tried to stay out of it, to focus on my studies and my future. But she just kept spiraling downward.\"\n\nMy wife's voice cracked as she continued. \"One night, she was killed in a drive-by shooting. I was devastated. I felt guilty for not being able to save her, for not being there when she needed me.\"\n\nI pulled her into a hug, feeling a deep sadness wash over me. \"Oh, baby,\" I whispered. \"I'm so sorry. Why didn't you ever tell me?\"\n\nShe pulled back, her eyes red-rimmed. \"Like I said, it's too painful. I didn't want to burden you with my grief.\"\n\nI shook my head, feeling a mix of anger and compassion. \"How could you think that? We're partners, aren't we? We're supposed to share our joys and our sorrows.\"\n\nShe looked down, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I know. My apologies. It's just... I didn't want to lose you too.\"\n\nI pulled her close again, holding her tight. \"You won't lose me,\" I promised. \"We'll get through this together. I'm here for you, always.\"\n\nWe stood there for a long time, holding each other and crying. Finally, my wife spoke up again.\n\n\"Thank you for understanding,\" she said, her voice still shaky. \"But there's something else. Something I need to tell you.\"\n\nI looked down at her, confused. \"What is it?\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"The detective working on Sarah's case... he thinks it might not have been a random act of violence. He thinks she might have been targeted.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. \"Targeted? Why?\"\n\nMy wife hesitated again, then blurted out. \"Because... because Sarah was involved in some dangerous stuff. She was dating this guy, a drug dealer. And I think... I think he might have had something to do with her death.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped as I processed this revelation. My wife had been carrying this secret around for years, afraid to tell me. Afraid to lose me.\n\nI pulled her close once more, feeling a wave of love and determination wash over me. \"We'll get through this together,\" I promised again. \"We'll find out who did this to your sister, and we'll make sure they pay.\""
