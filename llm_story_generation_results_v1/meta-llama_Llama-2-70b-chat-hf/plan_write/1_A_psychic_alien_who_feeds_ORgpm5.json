Beneath his calm demeanor, he harbors a growing fascination with human emotions, particularly fear.\n\nSupporting Character: Detective James \"Jim\" Chen, a no-nonsense investigator tasked with uncovering the mysterious causes behind the sudden increase in nightmares. He's tough, practical, and possesses a dry sense of humor.

He becomes entangled in a complicated relationship with Samantha, who sees the good in him despite his predatory nature. As Jim investigates the strange occurrences, he must navigate his own nightmares and confront his feelings about Zor-Xex's presence.\n\nAll options explore the complex dynamics between the three characters, challenging their beliefs, motivations, and values.
