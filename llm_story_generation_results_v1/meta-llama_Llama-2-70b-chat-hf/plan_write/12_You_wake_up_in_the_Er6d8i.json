    "story_prompt": "You wake up in the middle of the night, your arm hangs over the side of your bed. It\u2019s pitch black & your room is shrouded in deep shadow. Something unseen seizes your hand. You grasp it tightly, knowing that first impressions are important & a firm, confident handshake establishes dominance.",
    "characters": "\nAlright! Here are three major characters in this scenario:\n\n1. The protagonist, Alex: Alex is a strong-willed and independent person who values control and dominance. They have always been a light sleeper and are easily startled, but they never show fear. Alex has a lot of pride and hates being caught off guard. They are determined to figure out what's going on and will stop at nothing to uncover the truth.\n\nEmotional state: Alert, curious, and slightly annoyed.\n\nInner thoughts: \"What the hell is going on? Why can't I see anything? Who or what is grabbing my hand? I need to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\n2. The unknown entity, Erebus: Erebus is an ancient and powerful being from another realm. It has the ability to manipulate darkness and shadows, and it feeds on human fear. Erebus is intrigued by Alex's strength and determination and decides to make contact.\n\nEmotional state: Curious, playful, and slightly hungry.\n\nInner thoughts: \"This human is different. They're not afraid of the dark, and they're not afraid of me. I wonder what they'll do when they realize who I am.\"\n\n3. Alex's roommate, Samantha: Samantha is a timid and sensitive person who is often bullied by Alex's strong personality. She's a heavy sleeper and usually doesn't wake up during the night. However, she's been having strange dreams lately, and she senses that something is off.\n\nEmotional state: Fearful, uneasy, and a little confused.\n\nInner thoughts: \"I don't like this. I don't know what's happening, but I know it's not good. Why won't Alex wake up? Maybe I should go to the living room and try to sleep there.\"",
    "output": "\nAdditional notes: \n\n* The setting is a small apartment shared by Alex and Samantha. The bedroom is dimly lit by a small nightlight. The atmosphere is oppressive, heavy with an unsettling energy.\n* Erebus's presence is manifest through the shadows. At first, it's hard to distinguish its presence from the normal darkness of the room. As the encounter progresses, its power becomes more evident, making the shadows seem alive and sentient.\n* Alex and Erebus have a complicated dynamic. They're both strong-willed and determined, but their motivations and intentions clash. Erebus is fascinated by Alex's fearlessness and wants to understand and exploit it, while Alex resists Erebus's attempts to manipulate them. Their interactions should be intense and charged with tension.\n* Samantha plays a secondary role in the story, mostly observing and trying to make sense of the strange events. Her parts should be brief but impactful, showing her growing unease and fear.\n* The climax of the story should involve a confrontation between Alex and Erebus. It can take various forms\u2014a verbal argument, a physical fight, or a psychological battle\u2014but it should be emotionally resonant and leave both characters changed.\n* The aftermath of the encounter should leave the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty. It's unclear what the future holds for Alex, Erebus, and Samantha.\n\nIn summary, this is a psychological horror story with a supernatural twist. The focus should be on the emotional and psychological aspects of the characters' interactions, rather than gore or cheap scares."
