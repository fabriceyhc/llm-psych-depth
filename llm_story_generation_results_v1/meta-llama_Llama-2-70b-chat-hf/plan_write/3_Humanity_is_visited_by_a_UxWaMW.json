    "characters": "\nAnswer: \nCharacters:\n1. Emily - Emily was an astronomer who first detected the anomaly that would become known as the cosmic horror. She has been studying it closely since its arrival and feels an overwhelming sense of responsibility for the safety of the planet. Her emotional state swings between anxiety and resolve, but she keeps her feelings in check around her team. Despite this, she has become increasingly isolated as she struggles to come to terms with the magnitude of what they face. Internally, Emily questions whether she should be focusing on a way to communicate with the creature or a plan to destroy it before it destroys them. She has not slept well since the encounter began.\n2. Marcus - Marcus is a military commander who was charged with leading the attack on the cosmic horror. He struggles with the enormity of what they have accomplished and fears the consequences of their actions. He is torn between feeling proud of his team's success and terror that they have angered beings beyond their comprehension. He wonders if he made the right decision in trusting Emily's assessment that the creature was hostile. Despite his doubts, he maintains a strong exterior because his team needs him to be confident. Marcus replays the battle in his mind, questioning every decision he made. Did they really have no other choice? Can they still reverse the damage they have done? He also worries about how the other gods will respond to their actions. Will they be attacked next?\n3. Ayan - Ayan is a linguist specializing in ancient languages. She has been studying texts that may reference the creature, hoping to find a weakness or understand its intentions. Her mental state is a mix of excitement and apprehension. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for her, and she's determined to learn as much as possible. However, she is aware of the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences of her research. She fears failure and the cost it would have for humanity. Her thoughts are constantly racing with new ideas and questions to investigate.
