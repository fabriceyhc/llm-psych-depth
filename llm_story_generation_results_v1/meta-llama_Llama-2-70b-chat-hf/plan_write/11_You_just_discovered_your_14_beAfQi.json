As you hold the locket in your hand, waiting for the call, you can feel its power coursing through it. The call connects and you hear the ethereal voice of the Moon Goddess.\n\"Greetings, mortal. I have been expecting this call. You have questions, no doubt.\"\nYour emotions are mixed, angry at the fact that your daughter has to fight monsters and save the world, scared because you don't know what could happen to her, but also curious, wondering why this is happening and what the Goddess has planned.\n\nYou respond, trying to keep your voice level, \"Yes, Goddess, I do have questions. Why did you choose my daughter? What does this mean for her future?\"\n\nThe Goddess responds calmly, \"I chose your daughter because she has a strong heart and will. She is kind, compassionate, and above all, she has the potential to be a true hero. The power of the Moon Princess locket will help guide her on her journey, protecting her and granting her strength when she needs it most.\"\n\nThe assistant chimes in, \"Mortal, please understand that this is an honor and a privilege for your daughter. Many have sought to wear the locket and failed. Your daughter has proven herself worthy, and we will be here to aid and guide her as she grows into her role.\"\n\nThe conversation continues, the Goddess explaining the nature of the monsters your daughter will face, the balance between light and darkness, and the role the Moon Princess plays in maintaining that balance. All the while, you can't help but think about how much this is going to change your daughter's life, how much she's going to have to sacrifice, and how dangerous it all is.\n\nAs the call ends, the Goddess bids you farewell, \"May the blessings of the moon be upon you and your daughter. We will be watching over her closely. Fear not, for she is in good hands.\"\n\nYour emotions swirl, uncertain about what the future holds for your daughter.
