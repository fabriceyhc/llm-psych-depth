    "characters": "\nExample:\nMajor Character 1:\nName: Marcus\nAge: 30\nOccupation: Writer\nEmotional State: Ecstatic, proud, and a sense of accomplishment\nInner Thoughts: \"I can't believe it! My book is finally getting published! All my hard work has paid off. I'm going to be a best-selling author! I wonder what my significant other will think when they see the finished product.\"\n\nMajor Character 2:\nName: Lily\nAge: 28\nOccupation: Editor\nEmotional State: Mixed feelings - excited for her partner's success but also feeling neglected and ignored\nInner Thoughts: \"I'm so happy for Marcus. He's worked tirelessly on this book for years. But why did he have to go and get it published without me? We used to share everything together. Now it feels like he's keeping secrets from me.\"\n\nMajor Character 3:\nName: Samantha\nAge: 45\nOccupation: Book Store Owner\nEmotional State: Confused, taken aback, and a little annoyed\nInner Thoughts: \"I can't believe Marcus would do this. He's always been such a kind and considerate person. Why would he publish a book without telling his partner? And why does it have to be so different from the drafts he shared with me? This is just strange.\"",
    "output": "\n---\n\nMarcus had always been a driven person, but never more so than when it came to his writing. He spent every spare moment working on his novel, pouring his heart and soul into its pages. His significant other, Lily, was his biggest supporter, offering feedback and encouragement whenever he needed it. Together, they dreamed of the day his book would be published and he would become a successful author.\n\nThat day finally arrived, and Marcus was over the moon. He couldn't wait to share the news with Lily, but he wanted to do it in a special way. So, he decided to surprise her by buying a copy of his book in a local bookstore and presenting it to her as a gift.\n\nAs he walked into the store, Marcus felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. He couldn't believe how far he had come since he first started writing. Samantha, the owner of the store, greeted him warmly and asked how she could help. Marcus requested a copy of his book, and Samantha's face fell.\n\n\"Marcus, I'm not sure if you're aware, but your book...it's not exactly what we expected,\" she said hesitantly.\n\nMarcus's confusion grew as Samantha handed him a copy of his book. As he flipped through its pages, his heart sank. The words were all familiar, but the story was completely different from the one he had shared with Lily. Gone were the romantic subplots and thoughtful character development. In their place was a generic, action-packed thriller that bore little resemblance to the original story.\n\nMarcus couldn't understand what had happened. Had there been some kind of mistake? Did someone hack into his computer and change his manuscript? But as he looked at the cover, he saw that his name was still listed as the author. It was then that he realized the truth - he had unknowingly published a completely different book than the one he had written.\n\nFeeling embarrassed and ashamed, Marcus quickly left the store, hoping to avoid any further awkwardness. He knew he had to tell Lily the truth, but he didn't know where to start. How could he explain that his published book was almost unrecognizable compared to the one he had shared with her?\n\nWhen he arrived home, Lily met him at the door, excitement radiating from her eyes. \"Marcus, I heard the news! Your book is finally out! Let me see it!\"\n\nMarcus hesitated, unsure of how to proceed. He didn't want to ruin the moment, but he couldn't bear to deceive her any longer. \"Lily, there's something I need to tell you,\" he began, his voice trembling. \"The book that was published...it's not exactly what I wrote.\"\n\nLily's expression turned from eager to confused. \"What do you mean? What did you write?\"\n\nMarcus took a deep breath and explained the situation, leaving out no details. Lily listened intently, her face a mixture of shock, disappointment, and hurt. When Marcus finished, she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Why, Marcus? Why would you do this without telling me? We shared everything together. I thought we were partners, both in life and in our writing careers.\"\n\nMarcus felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He had never seen Lily so upset, and it broke his heart. \"I'm sorry, Lily. I don't know what came over me. I was just so focused on getting published that I didn't think about how my actions would affect you. Can you ever forgive me?\"\n\nLily didn't answer right away. She looked at the floor, her eyes welling up with tears. Marcus waited anxiously, hoping against hope that she would find it in her heart to pardon him.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Lily spoke again. \"I love you, Marcus. And I know you love me too. But this was a huge mistake, and it hurts that you didn't trust me enough to share your work with me before publishing it.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, feeling the weight of his guilt settle upon his shoulders. \"I understand. My apologies for hurting you. I promise to make it right, somehow.\"\n\nLily sniffled and stepped closer to him. \"I know you will. But for now, let's take some time to process this. Maybe we can work on a new project together, something that truly represents both of our voices.\"\n\nMarcus smiled weakly, grateful for Lily's generosity and willingness to move forward. They hugged each other tightly, both of them knowing that their relationship was strong enough to survive this setback.\n\nAs they pulled back, Marcus looked into Lily's eyes and spoke from his heart. \"You're right. Let's start fresh, together. And no matter what happens, I promise to always prioritize our partnership, both in life and in our writing careers.\"\n\nLily smiled, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. \"I love you, Marcus. And I'm ready to move forward, together.\""
