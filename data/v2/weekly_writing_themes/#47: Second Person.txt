Writers are often cautioned away from using second person point of view. And that's because it can be tricky to get right. But as writers like Junot Diaz, Lorrie Moore, and our contest's very own Hayley Igarashis proves, second person POV can also provide for an incredibly immersive reading experience.

This week, our prompts challenge you to write a story using second person POV. In other words, the story should address readers as "you," pulling them right into the narrative. You don't need to use the prompts verbatim in your stories â€” as always, they are meant to get your wheels of creative interpretation turning!
