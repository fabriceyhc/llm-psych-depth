I’m always surprised when I feel naturally at ease with someone new. It feels like falling in step with one another, dancing to the same track in the half-light, an imperceptible puzzle piece clicking into place. It’s both exhilarating and dizzying.

This week, I want us to spend some time thinking about that feeling, and explore those moments in our lives when we meet new people in either boring or serendipitous ways — be it making eye contact with someone on public transport, going on a first date, or meeting in a way that feels like destiny has intervened.
