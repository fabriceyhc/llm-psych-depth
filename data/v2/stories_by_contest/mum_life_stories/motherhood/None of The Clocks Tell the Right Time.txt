Leo is transfixed by the perfectly spherical, white globe. He squeals with delight as she holds it to her lips and blows away the tiny cloud with each puff of air:

“One o’clock, two o’clock, three, four, five… Dinner time!”

They tumble in the overgrown grass, amongst the seed heads which wait like little ticking time-bombs. Bang – she is pregnant. Boom – Gary leaves her, muttering about not being able to turn back the clock. Her life detonates. Now she must care for her son, who only sees his dad on alternate weekends, and go to work, and cook, and clean, and make time for endless chores. Every time she looks at a clock she thinks it must be lying about how much time has passed, or how little.

This weekend it is her turn to have Leo, who woke at dawn and refused to accept it wasn’t morning. He plays, and she sits on the step with another coffee. She had expected sleepless nights but assumed that they would end – perhaps nine or ten months of disruption – then, by the time her maternity leave ended, Leo would be sleeping through. Instead, at eighteen months old, Leo has not given her a single night of unbroken sleep and she wakes at unearthly hours even when he is not there. She is living out of time, as though permanently jet-lagged. She thinks of her bed and of how soon she can get Leo down for a nap and then talks herself out of that dream; she must cut the lawn or it will grow even more unmanageable – already it is choked with dandelions and countless other weeds. Mowing was Gary’s job.

Leo starts to wail. He is opening and closing his fists in bewilderment and it takes a while to solve the problem – he has dropped the dandelion he picked for her. After much consideration he finds a substitute and proudly hands it over.

“One o’clock, two o’clock…”

Together they travel through the markers of the day, past breakfast, snack, lunch and dinner, the remaining seeds clinging on obstinately. Finally, she brings her hand up, like a magician, and when it falls the stalk is empty.

“Ten o’clock – bedtime.”

She carries Leo upstairs before he has time to protest. Eventually, his breathing slows and his hand, sticky with sap, releases her own.

Back outside the air has grown warmer and she really should cut the grass while it is dry, but instead she lies down in it and closes her eyes. She is a child again, one for whom time has no authority. The drone of a mower starts up a few gardens away and close to her ear there is the answering buzz of a bee. She imagines Leo waking up to find the clocks have lost their faces. And for what? Because someone, a long time ago, decided that these beautiful plants were weeds? She sits up, chooses a clock and blows. It is her time now.
