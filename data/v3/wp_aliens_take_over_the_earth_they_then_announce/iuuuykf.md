“So let me make sure I understand that correctly. All our basic needs are met for working 16 hours a week? And if we have disabilities that mean we can’t work certain types of job we get preference for the kinds of work we can still do? And healthcare is included in basic needs, both visits and medications?”

“Yes, that’s all correct.”

“What’s the catch?”

“I don’t know what you mean?”

“What’s the catch? Are we going to have horrible working conditions that drastically shorten our lifespan, or bosses that make our work lives miserable? Are we going to have to worry about being stolen from our homes, or our kids eaten? Are we going to be conscripted into serving as cannon fodder?”

“No, of course not, that’s absolutely barbaric!”

“Are we going to have to wait in line for the hours we will now have free from work in order to get the things we need, only to find when we reach the front of the line that there isn’t any more of that thing or that we were in the wrong line? Are you planning on ensuring we are addicted to substances that temporarily make us happy but are actually very destructive in the long run as a means of keeping control of us?”

“No not at all, that sounds like a nightmare.”

“Then what? There has to be something, there is a saying here on Earth: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”

“We’re not from Earth.”
