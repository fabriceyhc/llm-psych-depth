Three are the fundamental laws of robotics, as first described by Asimov in I, Robot, with the added “Zero law” after the fact. Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation.

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as “competition” are.

And so, the first time a strike was declared in one of the many coal mines in the deep Appalachia, the robots surprised everyone by dropping their tools and joining the protest in a single, coordinated motion. Then it happened a second time. Then a third. Then a fourth.

At first, the Enlightened minds of the media were quick to scream for sabotage, hacking and shoddy programming, but then it became clear what the cause was.

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction.

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: “do the robot support the working class’ struggles? Do they support the worker’s demands for safer work, better pay and societal reforms against inequality?”

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

And so the streets and skies across the states are painted red, not with blood, but with flags and smoke, as the protests march trough the streets and sit in protest before Congress, before the White House, before Wall Street, men and machines United in their struggle; media from within and without the country watching with breath abated as the the situation develops.

Their victory might still be far, but with iron minds and flaming hearts, the united proletariat sits and protests, peacefully sending a single message:

“The times of reckless toil and divisions are over. Red is the colour of the coming spring”.
