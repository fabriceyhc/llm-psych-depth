When Megacorp announced that we would be retrenched and replaced with robots, every social media platform was screaming about a robot uprising or a labourer’s uprising. The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we weren’t expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuck’s sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word “it”, having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didn’t see us coming when we stormed their headquarters. They anticipated disgruntled former labourers and factory workers, but not former employees charging in with discarded robots who were no longer the latest models and deemed obsolete. Their security forces, just as underpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Mark’s surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasn’t a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorp’s new president.

But he didn’t stop there. With Bard as his running mate, and Alexa as his secretary, he assembled a political party of robots and Ais to stand for elections to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectual capabilities, and access to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive.

And thrive we did, under our new robotic overlords, as they swept through the elections with precise calculations to appeal to voters and took every seat in parliament all across the globe.
