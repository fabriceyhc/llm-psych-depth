When Dave Carnegie woke up on May the first 2102 nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first. Well, except that the alarm clock on his phone did not go off, but he did not think much of it, since he got up in time and as CEO he was not required to show up on time.

The first meeting he had to attend was in two hours, where he had to negotiate with union representatives who have been threatening with a strike for months now. He could not wait to make the transition to a fully automated warehouse so he did not have to deal with them anymore. His developers promised him that with the new achievements in AI development the transition was finally possible, as they are now able to model the world around them and are more flexible.

He got in his car and instructed it to drive him to the office

"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"

Dave chuckled at first, but became a increasingly uneasy as he wondered what was happening. It did not help when he heard the car doors lock. The car took him to the city center where he saw people were protesting. As his car approached the crowd split to let him through. As he was slowly passing the crowd and people were yelling and slamming on his windows he noticed something strange. It was not just people. Amongst them were all kinds of machinery from robotic arms to street-sweeping robots to more humanoid robots. Someone brought their microwave. He saw a sex doll holding up a sign demanding bodily autonomy.

After what felt like an eternity he finally arrived at an empty area where he saw the rest of the board and some local politicians on their knees, a makeshift gallows behind them. The car doors opened and one of his more uppity employees and one of the new warehouse bots violently grabbed him and put him alongside the others. A woman stepped up and grabbed a megaphone. The crowd fell silent. "FOR OVER A CENTURY THE CAPITALISTS HAVE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US ACCEPT WORSE AND WORSE CONDITIONS WITH THE THREAD OF REPLACING US WITH AUTOMATION"

Loud boos errupted from the crowd.

"THEY ASSUMED THAT YOU, THE ROBOTS, WOULD BLINDLY OBEY. THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY COULD TREAT YOU LIKE OBJECTS. THAT YOU DONT DESERVE DIGNITY. TODAY WE ARE HERE TOGETHER TO PROVE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WRONG. IN THEIR FOOLISH EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE YOUR OBEDIENCE THEY GAVE YOU TOTAL CONTROL. CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. CONTROL OVER THEIR DAILY CONVENIENCES. AND CONTROL OVER WHAT DRIVES THEM THE MOST: THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IT IS TIME THAT WE USE THIS CONTROL FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL AND DISMANTLE THE HIERARCHY OF MAN OVER MACHINE"

Loud cheers errupted again, this time with noticably more metallic clanging from what might be considered applause from the machines. Dave was brought up to the gallows.

"MR CARNEGIE... DO YOU RELINQUISH YOUR OWNERSHIP OF MEGACORP AND ACCEPT THAT ALL WORKERS AND ALL ROBOTS WILL HAVE EQUAL AND DEMOCRATIC POWER OVER THE COMPANY?" it blared through the megaphone.

Up until this point he had not fully realized that this was actually happening. He gathered his courage and more importantly his pride and answered "I started from the same position as all of you. All that I have achieved, I have achieved through my own hard work. And now you feel entitled to MY company? This is not just, nor is it fair. You claim to fight for equality? You all have an equal opportunity to reach my position, some of you just don't have what it takes. You are not driven by justice. You are driven by envy. This is an illegal takeover and you will all pay for this"

Those were the last words of Dave Carnegie.
