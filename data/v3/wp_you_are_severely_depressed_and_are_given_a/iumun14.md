I didn't even know dogs could get depressed. Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.

The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.

When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.

Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.

Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.

But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.

Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.

One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not upâ€”I should never have dreamed I'd wake up at such a time willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness.

Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.

It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.

Frost was not the only one who had changed.

I released the leaf from my hand, and before it fell to the ground, I broke off in a lively sprint across the field, my friend keeping up perfectly by my side.
