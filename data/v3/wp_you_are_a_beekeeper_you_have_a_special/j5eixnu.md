''So you're asking for what exactly? I want to help, but I want to make an itemized list to make sure I've got everything.'' I take my pen and paper and listen to them. From their buzzing I can understand that they would like an extra room or area just for the Queens alone.

''Now that is certainly possible, but I'd have to either expand the hive or remove some of the comb racks. I'll make it work, next?'' This one is longer. They want more protection against flies and spiders. Apparently they've had a few issues with larvae digging through the exterior wood of the hive and have had spiders set up a web right by the entrance.

''Well I can for sure solidify the exterior and maybe make it a harder wood so you don't have any larvae anymore, but I'm not sure what I'd do against the spiders, don't you guys have dedicated workers that handle that?'' Apparently not, as I hear from the buzzing.

''But how am I meant to keep away spiders? Best I can do is give them a once over with a brush every day, to remove cobwebs and chase away spiders. I'll add that to the list.'' They seem happy. That sound has always been my favourite to hear, their happy buzzing is soothing to my ears.

''Now so far I've got extra interior room for you, hardwood exterior to protect against larvae from flies and a once over with a brush every day to remove cobwebs and spiders.'' I summarise the list.

''Anything else?'' A timid buzz from the youngest Queen attracts my attention. She wants some more protection from the wind, her hive is the most exposed of the six and on windy days it's nearly impossible for the worker bees to fly out and collect nectar.

''I'll set up a windscreen nearby, or I can move the hive itself. That's up to you.'' A thankful buzz from her tells me the answer.

''So in summary, I'll expand the hives, make them a bit bigger so you have more space from the same amount of comb racks. I'll also replace the older wood on the outside with a harder variety and maybe find some way to deter flies. I'll make sure to clean up each hive with a brush to remove cobwebs and spiders and I'll move the youngest hive closer to the flower patch, away from the wind. Was that all?''

Despite their happy buzzing I worry for the price these changes would cost. What can I make with just honey? I begin playing with the idea of brewing some type of drink, like wine but instead of grapes, I use the honey. I'll call it...Mead.
