As you can see, the bee in front of me buzzed in morse code, the Queen believes that our professional relationship can now move to the next level.

I took a sip of my honey-chamomille tea. "Do go on," I replied calmly.

We have observed the transactions with the rent you remove from our hive.

"The honey," I corrected.

Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made. As you can see here... the bee said as a swarm of new bees flew in and formed a chart, building a larger larval area with additional entrances sun-ward would increase the hive's Rent production by 51% as soon as the following summer.

"Interesting."

Furthermore, removing the large human structure next to us and planting cherry trees in the area would further improve both our quality of life and the quality of the Rent.

"I'm afraid that's my neighbour's house, ma'am. Can't raze that."

Is a hostile takeover out of the question?

"Completely."

The bee paused for a second. Understandable, it finally buzzed.

"Still - a new larval pod with more entrances? That is not an issue. I can get that done in... 3 weeks? Unless an emergency at work happens."

The bee jumped up and down excitedly.

Very speedy! The Queen will be pleased.

"Excellent!" I chuckled and clasped my hands. "Would you like this in writing?" I laughed.

The bee stood still.

What's writing?
