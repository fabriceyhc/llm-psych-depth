"Quit your bullshit. You're all 5 years old, and your hives are quite likely to mutiny on you this year, tricking you into laying eggs for your successors. When the first one hatches, this younger, stronger, more virile queen is going to try to kill you - just as you did to your mother. If you're lucky, you'll escape with a contingent of simps, in search of a new home. At that point, you can either go through the effort of building a new hive - probably at at an inopportune time of year - or I can help you by giving you a ready made hive to populate."
