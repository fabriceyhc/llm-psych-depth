Fuck this clown nose! Well, dont literally fuck it. I'm pretty sure if you fuck it you'd end up jizzing in an aquarium across town. Why? Because apparently clowns think thats funny. Don't ask me how I know.

I was fighting with my girlfriend when I first decided to keep the clown nose. Let's call him Clappy for fun. So we're fighting, im squeezing Clappy, and I say " Well i wish you were your sister!"

Que the music. That stupid gladiator entance song every circus uses. Next thing we know a clown in white makeup with big ass red afro comes into our apartment. He picks up my gf, who goes stiff as a board, and begins to leave with her.

I'm frozen still.

After failing to fit her through the door several times, he exits the door. Then, he leans back in and, with only his face and one hand visable, he wags 1 finger.

Next, carrying her stiff as a board, this bafoon comes running in with my girlfriends sister. She looks completely complacent. He sets her down like a bowling pin. Then this jackass leans back, picks up his arms, and bolts from the apartment.

Now, I can move. I ask Casey (my girlfriends sisters name) what just happened! She seems to know nothing, and is under the impression we are dating...and have been for years. Every memory i had with my girlfriend is now shared with her.

My girlfriend? Shes been missing ever since that day. Police are baffled where she could be.

Fuck this nose. Fuck Clappy. Tho, Casey is nice. And we do live debt free. Too bad I wished I was dead this morning.
