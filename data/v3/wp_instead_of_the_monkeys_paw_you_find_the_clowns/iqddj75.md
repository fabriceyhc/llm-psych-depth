The bright red ball was distinct amongst the other curios. So much so I stopped my browsing and had to ask. "Why do you have this locked in display?"

The shopkeeper made their way to MD smoothly and adjusted their glasses. "Ah! This is a very special item, I dare not part with it."

I raised my eyebrows and prompted them to explain further. They shifted and coughed, "Well, I haven't tested it myself but I've heard it can grant the desire of anyone who grasps it."

I looked at them skeptically. "To be honest, I don't believe it, but better safe..." They said. I sighed, "I'll test it, we will wish for something simple, like a glass of water. I'm thirsty."

They shook their head, "How can I trust you'll do so?" "Can you trust yourself?" The shopkeeper nodded, "So you've never been ... curious?" I smiled.

Moments later. the case was open and they had the ball in their hands. "I just want something to drink... I just want something to drink." They repeated aloud.

They held the ball up tentatively and squeezed it twice.

HoNk HoNk!

A flower lapel appeared on my shirt and suddenly water squirted out of it at the shopkeepers face! They were so taken a back, the ball flew out of their hands and landed in mine.

'Finally,' I sighed, 'The first piece of Bozo.'
