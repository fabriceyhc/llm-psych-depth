The locket was more ornate than anything I had seen, lying casually on Jessica's dresser amidst scattered hair ties and friendship bracelets. As I picked it up, a faint, silvery glow emanated from it, casting soft shadows on my hand. Out of curiosity, I opened it, half expecting to find a tiny picture of her crush from school.

But instead, I was greeted by a holographic face, radiant with a beauty that seemed almost...divine.

"Ah, you must be Jessica's mother," the face said. Her voice was melodious, like chimes on a breezy day.

"Who... Who are you?" I stammered, shocked.

"I am Lunaria, the Moon Goddess," she replied, her ethereal eyes scanning my face. "Your daughter, Jessica, has been chosen as the Moon Princess, tasked with the responsibility of protecting the world from the dark forces that threaten to overshadow it."

I took a moment to process this. My 14-year-old, my baby girl, protecting the world? "You've got to be kidding me," I whispered, mostly to myself.

Lunaria's gaze was gentle yet firm. "I understand your concerns, but Jessica was chosen because of her pure heart and unwavering courage. She—"

"Pure heart? Unwavering courage?" I interrupted. "She's a child, Lunaria. She gets scared when there's a thunderstorm. She needs me to kill spiders in her room!"

A shadow of sympathy crossed Lunaria's face. "I know it's difficult to fathom, but there is a strength inside Jessica that even she doesn't fully comprehend yet."

Tears filled my eyes. "Why her? Why put the weight of the world on a 14-year-old’s shoulders? You could've chosen anyone – someone older, wiser."

Lunaria sighed, a sound like a gentle breeze rustling leaves. "The balance between light and dark is delicate. Sometimes, it's the innocent, the ones with untapped potential and untainted souls, who make the best guardians. Jessica's youth is her strength. The world needs her purity, her optimism, her raw courage."

"I just... I want to protect her," I admitted, voice breaking.

Lunaria's holographic face softened. "I understand, but she is not alone. As the Moon Princess, she has access to powers and allies that will guide and guard her. And remember, she has you. Your love, your guidance, your wisdom. Every hero has a home to come back to, a family to anchor them. You are hers."

I blinked away my tears, steadying my voice. "Promise me she'll be safe."

Lunaria paused for a moment, and then whispered, "I cannot promise she won't face danger. But I promise she won't face it alone. And every time she transforms with this locket, it is filled with more than just my power. It carries your love, your hopes, and your dreams for her. That is the strongest armor any hero can have."

I nodded, clutching the locket tightly. "Then... guide her well, Lunaria. And if ever she needs, call upon me. There’s no force in the universe that can stand against a mother protecting her child."

Lunaria's lips curved into a tender smile. "Indeed. I will remember that."

I placed the locket back on the dresser, knowing now that my daughter's secret life was both a gift and a responsibility. As I exited her room, I felt a strange mix of pride and fear, but above all, an unwavering determination to stand by her side, no matter what lay ahead.
