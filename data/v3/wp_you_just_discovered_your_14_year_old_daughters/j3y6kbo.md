I open the locket, slowly and a beam of pink light shines out, filling the room. My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.

"Molly." I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.

"Molly!" I yell this time.

"Hello." I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. "I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother."

"I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?" I ask, trying to control my own voice.

"I am the night."
"Where's Molly?" I say again.

"I said, I am the night!" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. "I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves."

I roll my eyes. "Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!"

"She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side."

I stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.

"Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant." I yell.

"I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . ."
I cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.

"She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job."

"College?" The moon goddess pauses. "College?" She croaks.

"Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history." Please not art history, I think.

"Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.

I shake my head. "NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way."

"She doesn't know how to fight evil?" The moon goddess asks.

"NO!" I scream. "Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!"

I take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink.

"Her hair!" I yell into the locket.

"Sorry." The moon goddess is gone. The lights go out and I take one step back to turn the lamp on.
