"Anabelle, how lovely to hear from-... You're not Anabelle," the image of the ethereally-beautiful and pale figure declared.

"No I'm not," I said through gritted teeth. "Explain why you know my daughter."

"You must be her father. I see. Where is Anabelle?"

"No, no, I'm the one asking questions. Who the fuck do you think you are?" I snarled.

The delicate eyebrows of the Moon Goddess furrowed gently. "That's not an appropriate tone-" she attempted to chide.

I barked in harsh laughter, interrupting her. "Like hell it isn't! I have half a mind to smash this thing right now! Only reason I haven't already is because Annie begged me to at least talk to you first. So talk."

The Moon Goddess sighed and smoothed her far-too-sheer dress. "I'm glad Moon Warrior Anabelle is well. What did she tell you?"

"She told me enough," I said. "She told me that this gem thing basically turns her into a superhero to fight the, what did she call it?"

"The Shadow that lurks in the hearts of men?" she offered helpfully.

"Yeah, that. Makes people into monsters. You have my daughter fighting goddamn monsters!" I shouted. "What's wrong with you?"

"What's wrong, sir, is that I've been sealed away from the Earth, unable to protect it. People are dying. Your world will fall under the Shadow if nothing is done," she said, limpid eyes imploring me.

But I was unmoved. "One of those people could by Annie," I said. "This is wrong. Why her?"

"Only those with love in their heart, pure and true, could hear my call. Your Anabelle answered. She recognized the threat posed by the shadow. She is a remarkable girl."

"I know," I said quietly. I thought hard. "You said those with a pure heart could hear you, but I can hear you now. What's different?"

"You have a Moonstone, one of five that I could create. It allows our connection and allows me to transform Anabelle into a Moon Warrior," she explained.

"Would it only work on Annie?" I asked.

The Moon Goddess pondered a moment. "I suppose not. After all, you can reach me with it. But the user's love must be pure and burn bright, or else the Shadow will defeat you."

I nodded grimly. "Believe me, Moon, a father's love definitely burns bright. Annie's not going to fight for you anymore. I'm taking her place as Moon Warrior Dan. And I'll be talking to the parents of any other kids too. Take it or leave it, but nothing, no goddess and no shadow, will endanger my kids!" I shouted, triumphantly engaging my transformation sequence.
