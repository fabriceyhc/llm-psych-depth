There was a certain charm to playing a long line of eccentric nobles over the years. Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings. Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask. I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation. I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like. A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for. The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right. Something was missing. That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense. There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand. It was truly a marvel of technology. Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny. Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries. A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface. His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did. I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight. And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well. A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...
