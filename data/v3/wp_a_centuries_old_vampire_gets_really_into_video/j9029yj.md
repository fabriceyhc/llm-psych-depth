"The Sun is quite beautiful in this game."

"You think? The graphics are kinda dated."

"You wouldn't understand. You get to see the real deal every day. I don't. One ray of sunshine and..."

"And what?"

"I die."

"Dramatic. What are you, ginger?"

"A vampire. I'd literally die."

"...sure."

"So who's this character you're leading me to?"

"A friendly knight. Spawned a whole bunch of memes for being the one good thing in this dark, forsaken world."

"Not that dark. I've lived through the literal Dark Ages. This game reminds me of that, actually. At least, the fashion does."

"You're really committed to this bit, ain'tcha? Anyway - that's him."

"Fancy armour. He... gave me an emote?"

"Yeah, but mainly the soapstone-"

"The- the emote, he- it's..."

"You alright dude?"

"I just need a minute. Sit here, enjoy the view. Is that alright?"

"Yeah, sure. It's nice to get immersed in the view. I'll go grab a drink."

"Yeah."

"..."

"I agree with you, fair knight.

Praise the Sun."
