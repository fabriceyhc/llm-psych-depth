"Zjim." Zjim offered, stepping up to the stage.

"Jim? What's your last name?" the speaker asked. She flipped through the results print off.

"It's Zjim, actually. You can call me Jim though if it's easier. My last name's Zupp."

She flipped to the end of the report. "Wow, okay. Yeah, I do see you. You only received a single downvote. It looks like your name actually ended up printed on the back of the ballot by itself."

"That was me. Thought it was only fair if I voted for myself."

"Do you even understand how the new ballot system works? You vote for the people you don't want in office."

"I understand," Zjim straightened his ill-fitting tie. He hadn't worn one since fourth grade when he was 4-H treasurer. It was a little small now. "I don't want in office. My mom said I could only keep living with her if I was actively applying to jobs, so I figured running for president, you know, that's a job. I didn't do any campaigning or anything, either."

The woman's sighed, and pulled back the curtain to reveal the crowd of people gathered at the square. Their applause died as they saw Zjim wave with a pursed lip smile.

The woman nudged him, whispering out the side of her mouth. "They're expecting a victory speech."

Zjim waddled out to the podium amidst silence.

"Hi mom," he said into the microphone. "Make sure you feed the cat. I probably won't get home until late."

A wave of shuffles and coughs carried from the crowd as they turn to look at each other baffled.

"Thanks for electing me, everyone. I'm glad I managed to not upset any of you yet."

Zjim wandered back behind the curtain.

"Who the hell was that?" From the otherwise mute crowd. Several laughs followed, breaking into chittering discussion.

"That's it?" The woman asked. It was the question that would be asked many more times through President Zupp's term.

The man that would go on to lead the Free world into an era of peace, prosperity, and nationwide economic coziness shrugged. "Where's the bathroom in this place?"
