Ameth-ta had ten thousand eyes, and every last one of them was weeping. Rashe-son-del slammed a tankard of fermented souls into its three-lobed maw, drunkenly cursing. That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

"I'd—hic—I'd like to thank you all for coming," Rashe-son-del slurred out. "The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh." The assembled deities rumbled in approval. "When we first got word that The Devourer's soul-planet had developed life, I'd like to think that nobody was happier about it than The Devourer itself, may its soul blaze on."

"Hear, hear," Ameth-ta rumbled.

"But when that life metastasized—when it warped the planet so much that ol' Devvy started to sicken and die—did they listen when we told them to stop? No! They just clutched their ears and screamed as their internal organs liquefied from the deific pressure of our voice. And when we tried to force them into behaving—"

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. "The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their own fucking planet. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them."

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

"They paid the price, of course." Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. "No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy."

The assembled deities roared in agreement—

And then Rashe-son-del froze mid-sentence, doubling over as if struck by a cosmic baseball bat.

"What?" The eldritch entity from beyond humanity's universe opened and closed its mouth in incomprehension. "How can—who dares—"

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet had lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

"No," Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. "You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take everything from us?"

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

"But how... how did they find..." That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know which planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

One by one, across the cosmos, stars flared bright before winking out forever. And one by one, the gods they'd sustained did too.
