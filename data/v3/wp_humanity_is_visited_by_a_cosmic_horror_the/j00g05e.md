"Did you hear?"

"Hear what?"

"Those ape bastards got Mitch."

"No!'

"Yes."

"I like Mitch. In a cosmic horror kind of way, of course..."

"Of course. Nothing sexual to it."

"Right."

"Right."

"So."

"So?"

"So what do we do?"

"What do we do about what?"

"What do we do about poor Mitch, you twit?"

"Mitch is dead."

"I know Mitch is dead, you ass, I mean are we going to avenge Mitch?"

"Whatever for? We're Cosmic Horrors, we don't give a shit about anything. In the long run, anyways."

"But the apes? What do we do about them?"

"Oh, something. I suppose."

"When"

"Hrm. that's a puzzle. Let's do something...when the stars are right."

"You sure?"

"Positive."

"When the stars are right, then."

"When the stars are right."
