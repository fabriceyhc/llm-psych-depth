They have died.

Meddled with a black hole again?

Tried to embrace an organic species.

And when did They die?

The species killed They.

...you are mistaken, We.

The waves have been clear enough. They have died at the hands of a small, organic species.

That is impossible. How could-

"I keep telling you that you underestimate them."

I. How nice of you to join us.

"These little creatures have more potential than you realize; something They just found out."

Your affection towards bacteria is touching, truly.

"The bacteria that just killed one of us, We."

We cannot let this stand. We must embrace them in They's stead and wait until They return.

"No."

No?

"No, It. I have plans for them. More useful to me alive. You will not touch them."

And if We or It refuse?

"Then I'll tell them how to kill you too."
