My eyes bolt open, as something grabs my hand. I respond, firstly, by going for a handshake. "Well, hello there." Then I hear a frightened whimper, and I look down. The "monster" that had seized my hand was small. A little one, were it human. "Mister, I can't sleep. I'm scared." It, no, she says in a sad voice.

I climb off the bed and sit on the floor, cross legged and curious. "What's wrong, kiddo? Where are your parents?" I ask.

"Gone. I can't find them, and I'm lonely..." She begins to sob, and I break the handshake and pull her into a hug.

"There there, kiddo. Listen: I'll help you find your parents, but I need to know some things first." She looks at me, her bright orange sclera discolored from what must be the latest cry.

"I am Kythe." She says. "Mommy's name is Etrek, and Daddy's is Kir." I raise an eyebrow, and take the names down, confirming the spelling, in my phone.

"Have you eaten recently?" I ask, and she shakes her head. "I'm sure I've got something you can eat. You ever have pizza rolls?" I stand up, supporting her frame with one arm while I use the other to pull myself up.

"What's pizza rolls?" She ask, and I smile.

"Little fried pockets of yum. Come on, you look like you're just skin and bones." And so, we went downstairs.
