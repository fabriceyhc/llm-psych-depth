The silence of the night was a living thing, wrapping itself around the room like a shroud. In the stillness, Elsa stirred, turning in her bed to find a more comfortable position. Unbeknownst to her, her arm dangled precariously over the edge of her mattress.

In the ocean of darkness, the unexpected happened. A cold hand grabbed her wrist. Instead of recoiling in terror, Elsa’s instincts, honed from years of challenging boardroom meetings and power plays, took over. She squeezed back firmly, establishing the grip of someone who had faced many battles and emerged victorious.

Minutes stretched into infinity. The unseen entity held onto her, its grip neither hostile nor friendly. But Elsa’s mind raced, not with fear, but with curiosity. The pressure of the entity’s grasp conveyed a story of its own - a deep well of emotions and past experiences. Every scar, every wrinkle in its palm was a testament to trials faced and conquered.

What did it want from her? The shadows of the room whispered secrets, tales of past nights when the entity sought connection, an anchor in the ever-shifting currents of existence. In Elsa’s firm grip, it found solace.

With eyes still closed, she whispered into the abyss, “Who are you?”

There was a pause, a soft sigh, and then a voice, tender yet melancholic, answered, “A memory you’ve forgotten, a dream you’ve neglected, and a hope you've buried."

She mulled over the words, understanding that the hand might be an embodiment of her subconscious. Over the years, Elsa had suppressed emotions, ignored gut feelings, and overlooked dreams. She was successful in the world's eyes, but at what cost?

Tears pooled in Elsa’s eyes as memories of lost friendships, abandoned passions, and forgotten promises played before her. The grip on her hand tightened, the entity pulling her deeper into a tapestry of emotions. Instead of resisting, she allowed herself to be submerged in it, understanding the delicate intricacies of her own heart.

She saw herself as a child, the world full of wonder and endless possibilities. As a teenager, the fiery passion to change the world. And then, the gradual shift, where dreams were traded for stability, and passions were dulled for practicality.

The entity's grasp began to weaken. Elsa felt an overwhelming sense of loss, realizing that holding onto these buried emotions was what kept the entity alive.

“I won’t forget again,” she whispered, holding onto the hand even more tightly, attempting to anchor it to the present.

The entity’s reply was a mere sigh, but it held volumes. “Remember me, not in sorrow, but in hope. Let the dreams of yesterday fuel your tomorrow.”

As dawn approached, the hand slowly melted into the shadows, leaving Elsa alone, but with a heart full of memories and dreams rekindled.

The next morning, bathed in the soft sunlight filtering through her curtains, Elsa began to pen her first novel, breathing life into her long-forgotten dreams, one word at a time.
