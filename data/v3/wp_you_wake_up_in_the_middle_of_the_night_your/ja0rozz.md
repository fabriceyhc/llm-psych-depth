“My father always told me to look a man in the eye when you shake his hand,” said Tyler. He spoke firmly and confidently into the dark of his bedroom, hand clasped tightly around…something, just under his bed frame. “I can’t very well look you in the eyes if I can’t see you, friend.”

“Not a man,” said a quiet voice, muffled behind the bedskirt. “Not a friend,” it said louder.

Tyler tightened his grasp. “That’s my fault, friend,” said Tyler, ever cool in awkward social settings. “I should not have misgendered you. You see, my father was old school, and I should probably modify his sayings for the modern age.”

“Not a friend,” said the voice again.

“Well, I’d hate to break it to you, friend,” said Tyler jovially, “but where I come from—which just so happens to be here—a handshake that lasts this long is called holding hands. And if we ain’t friends holding hands, then we must be lovers.”

“Lovers?” Said the voice noticeably caught off guard.

Tyler’s father had taught him many things in life. The handshake thing, sure. Something about never trusting a fart after Tijuana Tuesday—another truism Tyler would need to modernize. But one of the most important things Tyler’s father had taught him was this:

If you’re caught in a bad situation, always be the craziest one in the room—no one wants to mess with crazy.

“You heard right,” said Tyler quietly. “We must be lovers. You’re already in my bedroom, you’re holding my hand, what’s next, my sweet underbed lurker? What will we do with all this pent up…energy?” Tyler extended his index finger and began to lightly stroke whatever it was that he was holding.

Tyler heard muffled grunts as the being struggled to release itself from his grip. “Stop! Stop!” Shouted the voice. “Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?”

Tyler held strong. “Dude? What a cute pet name for me. I think I’ll call you honey!” Tyler crooned. “Come on up, honey! Let’s see what kind of trouble we can get into.”

Tyler felt the being below him thrash about under his bed, it’s body slammed against the underside of his box spring and rang loudly throughout the quiet house. “Seriously, dude. Let me go!” Said the voice. “I promise, I’ll leave, just let me go.” The voice sounded scared. Desperate.

Now it was Tyler’s chance to put to practice another of his father’s wise words:

If you ain’t gonna eat it, let it go quick.

“I always was more of a catch and release fisherman,” Tyler said. “You be good now, though. I don’t want to hear about you holding hands with other lovers around town, honey. I’m a jealous man,” Tyler said.

He loosened his grip and let go. Tyler heard the sound of claws against his hardwood floor as whatever it was scurried away as fast as it could.

Tyler fell quickly back to sleep, unfazed by his impromptu midnight hand holding session.

Shortly after falling back to sleep he felt a pressure on his chest. He opened his eyes to see his sleep paralysis demon staring back at him.

“Hey there good-lookin,” he said cheerfully.

“Don’t you ‘good-lookin’ me!” Said the Demon. “What the fuck was all that ‘honey’ shit earlier? You thought I wouldn’t see that?”

Tyler exhaled loudly. Another truism of his father’s:

Try as you might, you can’t out crazy crazy.
