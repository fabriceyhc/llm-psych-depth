Are you an author who loves LOVE? Do you have an idea for a super short story that needs to be shared with the world? If you answered yes to both of those questions this contest is for you!

Writing LOVE is a 500 word short story contest. The story can be fiction or non-fiction as long as it includes an element of love. The element of love can be a love of anything. A love for life, for nature, for a life partner, for peace, for justice, for a passion... The story also doesn't need to be about love, it just has to have an element of it. All genres welcome!
