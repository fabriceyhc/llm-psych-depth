The Button Wife
by Dara Elerath


The button wife bends her body across the bed, but the cloth husband 
is not interested in touching her. Instead, he phones the burlap wife. 
He likes the way her coarse skin brushes against his body. At night, the 
button wife cries, recalling how her husband used to clutch the dark 
thread of her hair. She knows the burlap wife’s curls scratch him in the 
fashion he prefers. The cloth husband has a passion for roughness, 
but the button wife, woven from cotton, has only been soft and yielding. 

One evening, she decides to scour the buttons of her eyes with a 
steel wool; she hopes her husband will love her again. Soon, they are 
scuffed and cracked. When her husband comes back he looks at her 
with anger. You have ruined your eyes, he says, how can I look at you 
now? Later, gazing in a hand mirror, she notes she is no longer 
beautiful. She lifts a pair of scissors and snips the strings that knot 
the buttons to her face. Then she can no longer weep; then she can no 
longer see her husband leave the house each evening. 

She irons the hem of her dress in darkness. She waits to hear the sound 
of his car speeding down plastic blacktop. She dreams of the burlap 
wife’s hair cutting her skin the way it cuts her husband’s. 

Sometimes, she pricks her arm with a darning needle to feel. The red 
thread that unspools from her body is long as a dog leash. She wonders 
then if she is a dog. She hopes the cloth husband will walk her when 
he returns. She resolves then to wag her tail in greeting. She resolves 
then to sleep at his feet.
