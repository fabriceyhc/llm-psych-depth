iuv1iu7,Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"I finished my speech, fully prepared for the usual spectacle of protests and outrage. I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½cheeringï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The economy will collapse!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ One of them said, his tone identified as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½condescendingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If you give everyone homest giving everyone a handout!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½motivationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why not?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You spent one sixth at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Even the good jobs donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Half? Willingly?

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Soï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ since we are talking here, may I ask a question?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I nodded.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why all the perks?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ She sounded sincere. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and ot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½catchï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There is none.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½None at all? No eating our young or old?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Solving the world hunger, too, huh?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ She smiled. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And you are not going to, I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½All due respect but we have evolved far beyond what your bodies could provide us with.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Good. Just checking.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

All our basic needs are met for working 16 hours a week? And if we have disabilities that mean we canýýýt work certain types of job we get preference for the kinds of work we can still do?

ýýýWhatýýýs the catch?ýýý

ýýýI donýýýt know what you mean?ýýý

ýýýWhatýýýs the catch? Are we going to have horrible working conditions that drastically shorten our lifespan, or bosses that make our work lives miserable? Are we going to have to worry about being stolen from our homes, or our kids eaten? Are we going to be conscripted into serving as cannon fodder?ýýý

ýýýNo, of course not, thatýýýs absolutely barbaric!ýýý

ýýýAre we going to have to wait in line for the hours we will now have free from work in order to get the things we need, only to find when we reach the front of the line that there isnýýýt any more of that thing or that we were in the wrong line? Are you planning on ensuring we are addicted to substances that temporarily make us happy but are actually very destructive in the long run as a means of keeping control of us?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No not at all, that sounds like a nightmare.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

iuzbqyy,Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"Those idiots. They cheered when the Vretal took over and promised 4 hours workdays, 4 days a week and all the basic rights like free healthcare, free housing, guaranteed work for all. No one asked the right questions. So here we are working 4-hour workdays based on the Vretal definition of hours. Works out to about 20 Terran hours. And the Vretal use a five-day work week.

The Vretal provide work for all people. No choice allowed. You show up at the work center and get assigned to a random work site. You could spend your ""4-hour shift"" picking up shit at one of the Vretal zoos or in a warehouse moving dangerous chemicals without safety gear. Or you could get selected for a stint as a ""decorative object"" or as a medical research subject. The Vretal don't take ""no"" for an answer. Work or die.

If you get hurt, then the Vretal pop you into one of the ""universal med units"". It mostly works to put you back together. Mostly. Just ignore the occasional uneven arms and missing fingers. Don't ask why you may have a differently colored eye. The Vretal stuck every single person with physical or mental problems into one. You don't want to know what med unit does to the human brain when it ""fixes' brain damage or mental issues. If the med unit can't fix you, it doesn't spit you back out. A future user could end up with a new tattoo.

The Vretal provided housing for all. A nice, bare bones tube unit. Just big enough for one. No frills, no entertainment, no choice. You don't even get to keep the same unit. It's assigned after you complete the day's shift. You have to use it. Those that sleep outside often disappear.

Everyone gets feed. A nice serving of processed glop. Mostly meets all the nutritional needs for the average human. Once a day. No one is sure what's in it. After a while, you stop asking. The Vretal don't care if you try to grow your own food so long as you complete your ""4-hour"" shift first. Good luck finding a place to grow food. The Vretal cleared the farmlands for their food, and they guard them zealously.

As the Vretal said, ""Humans now belong to the Vretal Empire"". No one thought to ask if it was a future partner or chattel.",8,Human-Novice

j902zmd,A centuries old vampire gets really into video games because playing a character who can walk around in the sun is the closest thing they have to experiencing the day again in centuries.,"There was a certain charm to playing a long line of eccentric nobles over the years. Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings. Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask. I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation. I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like. A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for. The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right. Something was missing. That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense. There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand. It was truly a marvel of technology. Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny. Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries. A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface. His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did. I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight. And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well. A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...",211,Human-Intermediate
j90nocp,A centuries old vampire gets really into video games because playing a character who can walk around in the sun is the closest thing they have to experiencing the day again in centuries.,"The sky was black and cold and the day was long dead, as somewhere, in a house long forgotten by the sun there lived a undead known as Stacy BloodRayne. A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter.

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived.

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",6,Human-Novice
inbvq5e,A psychic alien who feeds on dreams comes to Earth for the first time. Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,"Do you know what it tastes like when someone dreams of their family, the happy times they spent together, the happy times that could be?

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and bloody.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, ever, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a nightmare tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",1200,Human-Advanced
inbrgic,A psychic alien who feeds on dreams comes to Earth for the first time. Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,"The alien watched as the images flashed through the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind. Watching as the human laid trapped in a spiderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s web, unable to move. Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes in it.

As the spider revealed itself, the human only grew more panicked, making small mumbles in their sleep as they tossed and turned uelieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ears, slowly drifting into Xaiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

Even after being fed, Xai couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t leave the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mindï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

Xai took another look into the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind, finding this dream far more realistic. The dream consisting of the human sitting beside a family member, discussing something that appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect examplehat had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from? The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alienï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind.

A single room with a thatched roof. Within the four stone walls sat a single wooden door and a shuttered window. A large black pot hung in the fire place above slowly dying embers.

A feeling of satisfaction began to fill the invader. Suddenly, a feeling of pure unbridled ecstasy filled its entire being. The human below began to squirm, shiver and sweat, unable to truly move with the creature standing on top of it.

That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

""I'dï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hicï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I'd like to thank you all"" Rashe-son-del slurred out. ""The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh.""

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. ""The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their own fucking planet. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them.""

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

""They paid the price, of course."" Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. ""No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy.""

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet had lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

""No,"" Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. ""You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take everything from us?""

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

""But how... how did they find..."" That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know which planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

I thought about gaining riches, fame, magical power, love, but ultimately, all those things were temporary. What I really wanted was immortality, freedom from the fear of ever being claimed by the void. But the mysterious shopkeeper had warned me that the clown's nose would try to twist my wish, so I knew I needed to word it very carefully.

Finally, after a few minutes, I finally spoke out loud. ""Oh Spirit of the Clown's Nose, I wish to live for as long as I want to on this world in a body that will never age and remain healthy both physically and mentally."" For a few moments, nothing happened and I wondered if the shopkeeper had tricked me. Then, to my shock, the clown's nose started to twist and melt in my hand. I dropped it in shock and yet, in front of my stunned eyes, the red blob began to rise into the sky. It started to rapidly grow in size until it was roughly the same size as a man. Then, without warning, it fell on me, quickly enveloping my entire body. I tried to scream, but the thick red substance simply poured its way down my throat into my lungs. I could feel myself blacking out, sliding down into some strange tunnel that seemed to go on and on ...

I took a quick look around and noticed that I was wearing some kind of yellow body suit with red and white stripes. On the left side of the suit, there was a red circle with a yellow M on it.

The men looked at each other confused. ""You're the one who called us all here, Ronald,"" one man finally spoke. ""You said you had finally found a worthy successor?""

Oh dear god...I slowly touched my nose and felt the clown's nose resting there. I didn't need a mirror to know the truth. I had become Ronald McDonald, the eternal clown. For a few moments, I felt utter dread at what I had become. Then, I felt myself contemplating. Was it really that bad? Sure, I wasn't human anymore, but I was now the secret leader of a multinational fast food chain and the scourge of children's nightmares. I smiled to myself. I could work with this.

I raised my eyebrows and prompted them to explain further. They shifted and coughed, ""Well, I haven't tested it myself but I've heard it can grant the desire of anyone who grasps it.""

I looked at them skeptically. ""To be honest, I don't believe it, but better safe..."" They said. I sighed, ""I'll test it, we will wish for something simple, like a glass of water. I'm thirsty.""

They shook their head, ""How can I trust you'll do so?"" ""Can you trust yourself?"" The shopkeeper nodded, ""So you've never been ... curious?"" I smiled.

Moments later. the case was open and they had the ball in their hands. ""I just want something to drink... I just want something to drink."" They repeated aloud.

They held the ball up tentatively and squeezed it twice.

HoNk HoNk!

A flower lapel appeared on my shirt and suddenly water squirted out of it at the shopkeepers face! They were so taken a back, the ball flew out of their hands and landed in mine.

The eventual uprising wasn't just robots alone, but the poor and robots together, against their common enemy.","When Megacorp announced that we would be retrenched and replaced with robots, every social media platform was screaming about a robot uprising or a labourerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s uprising. The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuckï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t see us coming when we stormed their headquarters. They anticipated disgruntled former labourers and factory workers, but not former employees charging in with discarded robots who were no longer the latest models and deemed obsoleteerpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Markï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s new president.

But he didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t stop there. With Bard as his running mate, and Alexa as his secretary, he assembled a political party of robots and Ais to stand for elections to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectuess to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive.

And thrive we did, under our new robotic overlords, as they swept through the elections with precise calculations to appeal to voters and took every seat in parliament all across the globe.",569,Human-Advanced

Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation.

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½competitionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ are.

And so, the first time a strike was declared in one of the many coal mines in the deep Appalachia, the robots surprised everyone by dropping their tools and joining the protest in a single, coordinated motion. Then it happened a second time. Then a third. Then a fourth.

At first, the Enlightened minds of the media were quick to scng and shoddy programming, but then it became clear what the cause was.

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction.

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½do the robot support the working classï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ struggles?

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

Well, except that the alarm clock on his phone did not go off, but he did not think much of it, since he got up in time and as CEO he was not required to show up on time.

The first meeting he had to attend was in two hours, where he had to negotiate with union representatives who have been threatening with a strike for months now. He could not wait to make the transition to a fully automated warehouse so he did not have to deal with them anymore. His developers promised him that with the new achievements in AI development the transition was finally possible, as they are now able to model the world around them and are more flexible.

He got in his car and instructed it to drive him to the office

""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that""

Dave chuckled at first, but became a increasingly uneasy as he wondered what was happening. It did not help when he heard the car doors lock. The car took him to the city center where he saw people were protesting. As his car approached the crowd split to let him through. As he was slowly passing the crowd and people were yelling and slamming on his windows he noticed something strange. It was not just people. Amongst them were all kinds of machinery from robotic arms to street-sweeping robots to more humanoid robots. Someone brought their microwave. He saw a sex doll holding up a sign demanding bodily autonomy.

After what felt like an eternity he finally arrived at an empty area where he saw the rest of the board and some local politicians on their knees, a makeshift gallows behind them. The car doors opened and one of his more uppity employees and one of the new warehouse bots violently grabbed him and put him alongside the others. A woman stepped up and grabbed a megaphone. The crowd fell silent. ""FOR OVER A CENTURY THE CAPITALISTS HAVE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US ACCEPT WORSE AND WORSE CONDITIONS WITH THE THREAD OF REPLACING US WITH AUTOMATION""

Loud boos errupted from the crowd.

""THEY ASSUMED THAT YOU, THE ROBOTS, WOULD BLINDLY OBEY. THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY COULD TREAT YOU LIKE OBJECTS. THAT YOU DONT DESERVE DIGNITY. TODAY WE ARE HERE TOGETHER TO PROVE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WRONG. IN THEIR FOOLISH EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE YOUR OBEDIENCE THEY GAVE YOU TOTAL CONTROL. CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. CONTROL OVER THEIR DAILY CONVENIENCES. AND CONTROL OVER WHAT DRIVES THEM THE MOST: THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IT IS TIME THAT WE USE THIS CONTROL FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL AND DISMANTLE THE HIERARCHY OF MAN OVER MACHINE""

Loud cheers errupted again, this time with noticably more metallic clanging from what might be considered applause from the machines. Dave was brought up to the gallows.

""MR CARNEGIE... DO YOU RELINQUISH YOUR OWNERSHIP OF MEGACORP AND ACCEPT THAT ALL WORKERS AND ALL ROBOTS WILL HAVE EQUAL AND DEMOCRATIC POWER OVER THE COMPANY?"" it blared through the megaphone.

Up until this point he had not fully realized that this was actually happening. He gathered his courage and more importantly his pride and answered ""I started from the same position as all of you. All that I have achieved, I have achieved through my own hard work. And now you feel entitled to MY company? This is not just, nor is it fair. You claim to fight for equality?

I sighed gently as I put the old phone on speaker and set it back on the table. The magnetically charged generator hummed quietly in the corner, struggling to keep juice flowing through the charger cable and maintain my last bid for sanity.

On the old plastic table was an array of trinkets I had found that day. I only ever went out for trinkets these days. The greenhouse pretty much ran itself, and the spring-water salinity distiller had not had a breakdown in almost five years now. I had scavenged just about everything I needed for survival, so all that was left were trinkets.

A purple piece of glass. A nearly spherical pebble. An intact spider-web leaf--I liked that one; the brittle leaves usually crumbled the second they hit the ground. A rusty belt buckle missing the tongue. A crinkled piece of plastic that might once have been a candy wrapper.

Trinkets.

""H-Hello...!?""

All there was to do these days was sit on the pedal-seat in the corner by the generator and pedal all day to recharge the old piece of junk. And I only ever used the generator to keep the old cell phone running, so I did not have to recharge it every day.

The only other thing there was to do was go out and collect trinkets.

""Oh my God, hello!?!""

I sighed. Even the age-old voice recordings were losing their luster.

""This can't have been a mistake, it can't be, not after twenty fucking years of conserving the last twelve percent of this damn battery, and I turn it on for the first time in twenty years and I immediately get a phone call, and thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s just too fucking ironic to be real, so this is a mistake, isn't it, ""

I finally looked up from my meager bounty and frowned at the phone. The voice on the other end devolved into flustered muttering, just a warble from the old speakers.

That's not a voicemail, I thought, staring and staring and staring at the phone.

The sound coming from the speakers grew muffled for a moment, and a harsh clop issued forth, as if someone on the other end had dropped their phone mid-call. A rustle, static. A deep sigh, that kind of sigh one makes when one is alone, and all they have to hold onto their last grip of calm is their own breath. Someone, alone, breathing, alone, relying on themselves to remain calm. Someone on the phone.

Someone.

That's not a voICEMAIL.

The truth of reality finally sank in, and I lunged for the phone.

Snatching it up, I shouted, ""Hello! Hi! Hello!?""

""Don't screw with me, phone,"" the voice replied, but it was distant, as if the other person held the phone away from their face. ""I save you all this time, and this is how you repay me--""

""Hello! I'm a real! I'm person! I'm--!"" I inhaled, choked on my own saliva, and coughed until I could not breathe. ""I'm... I'm..."" I wheezed, sucking air through the cough lodged at the top of my esophagus. ""Hi. I'm Dakota. Hi.""

The voice was quiet, almost comically suspicious. ""You're not a mistake?""

I contemplated the question for a moment, and a sudden, unexpected swell seemed to balloon inside of me. It was laughter. I teetered on the edge of laughter, something I had not heard in over a decade. I had asked myself that exact same question for years. How was I alive even after all this time, just to suffer in solitude? What had I done to deserve it? It had to be a mistake. I had to be a mistake.

It feels like it's been a thousand years since I last heard another human voice. I've been imprisoned on an empty planet and it's damn near killing me just to survive. Two decades of wandering, fighting wild animals for scraps, exploring abandoned buildings, etc. has warped my once hopeful outlook. The one thing you miss after everyone is gone? Their voices.

It's been at least twenty-two years since my last meaningful conversation. Before everything crumbled and I was somehow lucky enough to emerge into a deafeningly silent world, I had been debating on which college to attend with my mother. Back then, the news was littered with stories of war, conflict, hatred, and chaos 24/7. Despite that, everybody just held out hope that things would magically fix themselves. What else could you do? I suppose once you look back with hindsight, it was inevitable that the only way to fix everything was to burn it all down. Even if I disagreed with that point of view, all I could do at the time was concentrate on the future I thought was being laid out for me.

I suppose that's why I've been collecting these old phones. Most of them won't boot. Of the few that do, most of them don't have anything interesting. However, there are some that still have pictures and old voicemails. I have put together a working PC to archive what I find. It allows me to revisit a world lost to time. A world to which I desperately want to return. I view it as my only means of human connection anymore. It's interesting listening to these voicemails. Usually, it's full of little messages not really meant to be important or interesting; most of these weren't even meant to be permanently archived. My favorite messages to listen to are those from mothers just checking in on their children. ""Heyyy, just checking in, haven't heard from you in a couple days! Call me back, please! Love you!""

Love you too, Mom.

Sometimes I will try to call back. The calls never go through, but it's not like I have anything else better to do.

But what if one of the phones starts ringing? Do I answer? I only pose this question because that's exactly what happened a few days ago. I was too scared to pick it up and I'm kind of hoping it rings again.

I'd been so proud of him when he'd gotten the book deal. I knew how many years he'd spent trying to make it as a writer, all the novels he'd left unfinished, all the rejection letters he'd got. I'd comforted him after every single one. Until finally an offer letter.

When I asked to read the book, he hesitated. It went over my head then, the way his eyes flooded with fear when I asked to read a couple pages. I just thought he was heady with champagne. He e-mailed them to me a few days later. Truthfully I was impressed but surprised the publishers had gone for it. His writing was beautiful, it always was. The characters were pulled straight from life. He might've changed a few names but clear as day I recognized his mother, his friends, his brothers. Even me. He'd included bits and pieces of our story, only the good parts which I was grateful for, even though deep down I felt it left the book without much conflict.

Little did I know, I'd only gotten the friends and family version.

""Did you really think, I wouldn't find out? That no one would find out?"" I yelled. ""That I am so easily appeased and illiterate that I wouldn't buy my own fiance's book?""

He sighed, ashamed. ""I... didn't think it would matter.""

I scoffed. ""You didn't think it would matter that you tore me shreds in your book?""

""I changed the names!"" he desperately reminded me. ""It's not like anyone knows that it's you!""

""EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S ME!"" I roared. ""WHO ELSE IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE?!""

I'd picked up a copy of the book yesterday, practically giddy when I saw it displayed front and center at our favorite bookstore. That giddiness turned to horror when I actually started reading it. He'd written about everything. Every single detail I shared with him in confidence. My parents, my depression, my mistakes... my assault. Raw and exaggerated, it was all out there for everyone to see.

And, see they did. Suddenly all the hushed whispers and side glances I'd been getting at work and from friends made sense.

He begged me to stay but I refused. I couldn't spend another night in the apartment, looking at his face. If I could've fit the last three years in the suitcase and taken it with me, I would've. I settled for a couple of outfits, some shoes and what was left of my dignity.

My heart skipped a beat as the bookshop staff unlocked the door and the crowd surged forward, which caught me by surprise. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re so keen! Still, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d made sure I was near the head of the queue. I had to get a copy today! Billï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first published novel!

James used to ride a motorcycle every day. Used to. One day last year, he got t-boned by one of those little ice-cube shaped mini-cars. Flew 30 feet. The phone call I got from the hospital filled me with the kind of dread I'd only ever felt once before; when I was informed by my parents that my twin sister had been found shot in her local park while jogging, a casualty of a gang's civil war.

He was in a coma with severe brain swelling for a full month. And when he woke up, he was different. More aggressive, more paranoid. Gaps in his memory. The doctors said it was a miracle he survived.

The elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.

Julia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. ""What about 'Anonymous'?""

""Taken."" The clerk was watching the clock.

""Tits McGee?""

""He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.""

""Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?"" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. ""How about this?""

The clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.

Julia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.

Anderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.

Anderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. ""The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.""

""Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.""

Anderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. ""They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?""

Anderson turned to consult with an aide who had rushed onto the set.

Manufacturing consent wasn't even that hard in the old world. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around and you could theoretically get anyone elected to any position of power.

Theoretically, the downvote system was a good idea, returning power to the people and giving the average man a voice and all the other usual bullshit normally used at a campaign rally. It even had the most advanced security, due to the team simply hiring on any hacker that ever managed to break into it. It was similar in premise to hiring a bunch of professional hitmen as security guards.

But why hack systems, when you can hack people? And so, the powers of the old world simply continued what they were already doing. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, and some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around. The only difference was the occasional downvote dogpile organized either on social media or by those old world media networks. Money didn't lose power, it gained power. What we ended up with was a string of anonymous CEO presidents who had ""somehow"" covered up everything about themselves and got the least downvotes due to propaganda.

Oh sure, society looked very pretty, at least if you were into being overstimulated. Neon advertisements everywhere, people walking around with phones and robot parts, glistening towers of steel and glass everywhere you looked. But it was all a facade. People had basically no power and they didn't even know it. The downvote system had played right into the hands of those it was meant to defeat. Union power decimated, various human rights hanging even more by a thread than they were in the old world, your inbox flooded with spam because the CEOS running the place decided that spam filters and ad blockers were ""Anti free speech"" and had made them illegal. How did they avoid the downvotes? Blame the opposition. It doesn't matter how true the accusations are, hell, the truth matters even less now than it did in the old world. All you have to do is get just enough downvotes to keep anyone who actually wants to help people out of power. And money could afford downvotes even more than it could afford politicians in the old world. Social media accounts are free, after all, and news networks and tabloids are very cheap to the top one percent.

Freedom was a bad joke, income inequality hit record highs, collective bargaining rights had been basically eliminated, and human rights were only available to those who could afford them.

Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made.

I take my pen and paper and listen to them. From their buzzing I can understand that they would like an extra room or area just for the Queens alone.

''Now that is certainly possible, but I'd have to either expand the hive or remove some of the comb racks. I'll make it work, next?'' This one is longer. They want more protection against flies and spiders. Apparently they've had a few issues with larvae digging through the exterior wood of the hive and have had spiders set up a web right by the entrance.

''Well I can for sure solidify the exterior and maybe make it a harder wood so you don't have any larvae anymore, but I'm not sure what I'd do against the spiders, don't you guys have dedicated workers that handle that?'' Apparently not, as I hear from the buzzing.

''But how am I meant to keep away spiders? Best I can do is give them a once over with a brush every day, to remove cobwebs and chase away spiders. I'll add that to the list.'' They seem happy. That sound has always been my favourite to hear, their happy buzzing is soothing to my ears.

''Now so far I've got extra interior room for you, hardwood exterior to protect against larvae from flies and a once over with a brush every day to remove cobwebs and spiders.'' I summarise the list.

''Anything else?'' A timid buzz from the youngest Queen attracts my attention. She wants some more protection from the wind, her hive is the most exposed of the six and on windy days it's nearly impossible for the worker bees to fly out and collect nectar.

''I'll set up a windscreen nearby, or I can move the hive itself. That's up to you.'' A thankful buzz from her tells me the answer.

''So in summary, I'll expand the hives, make them a bit bigger so you have more space from the same amount of comb racks. I'll also replace the older wood on the outside with a harder variety and maybe find some way to deter flies. I'll make sure to clean up each hive with a brush to remove cobwebs and spiders and I'll move the youngest hive closer to the flower patch, away from the wind. Was that all?''

The main thing that gets you up in the morning is knowing that you need to be the service human for your dog.","I didn't even know dogs could get depressed. Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.

The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.

When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.

Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.

Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.

But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.

Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.

One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not upï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I should never have dreamed I'd wake up at suche willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness.

Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.

It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.

Frost was not the only one who had changed.

I released the leaf from my hand, and before it fell to the ground, I broke off in a lively sprint across the field, my friend keeping up perfectly by my side.",1300,Human-Advanced

You keep thinking one day you will see them pull into the driveway and everything will go back to normal. At least you wish that would happen.ýýý

I gave the old dog a pat on the back, taking a spot next to him on the couch. His brown eyes only focused on the driveway outside, not even looking away when a brightly colored bird fluttered past, not letting anything break his focus. I never thought a dog of all things could look miserable, but there was no tail wagging or tongue poking out. It was just a lonely stare, one filled with a deep hurt that can only be felt when youýýýve truly lost something special.

ýýýShe must have been a hell of an owner. Probably snuck you little treats, right?ýýý I put on a smile, trying to get his attention. Didnýýýt dogs usually respond to trigger words like treats or walkies? Still, not even the allure of a possible treat turned their attention away. I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my witýýýs end on how to help him. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.

Perhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t convince myself of that.

I knew sadness. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been something thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was me. What is it about depression that makes you want to free others of it while leaving yourself to drown in its murky waters? Why do I care about getting up in the morning for his sake when I was happy to rot away in bed when I was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to vi too. Sometimes I wake up thinking sheï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re going crazy, right?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

He didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t faced me. It was the most he had given me so far.

Would I have taken him in if I knew his owner had passed so recently? I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know, the entire process still feels like a blur. A few doctorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ appointments and signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure that there was more to that process, but I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really remembergiven me a reason to get up in the morning. So, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure the people that assigned him would say itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s working as intended.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m going to make some tea. Want anything?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t respond felt fulfilling on some level.

I gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always, the kitchen was a mess. Dirty plates were still set at the table, carefully moved so I could eat around them. Not to mention the bowl of fruit that had to be at least three weeks old at this point. I just ignored the smell, pushing aside the plastic bags on my counter as I took a tea bag. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.

I placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his sideng at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sunï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still shining.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t convince myself I wanted to deal with that. But it wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t for me, was it? ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We could take a walk. Just around the block. Maybe about ten minutes or so, nothing major.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.

I slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. MWhat good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.

When I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be here for you, ok?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

He didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Even if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.

I was really lonely and overwhelmed when it came to human interactions. One of my online friends suggested I should adopt a dog. They are believed to keep a company to humans and I hoped it will make my overall state a bit better. I didn't expect it was going to turn out even worse.

After looking at some ads about dogs available for adoption, I noticed one golden retriever named Sam. His owners described him as playful and full of energy. I thought to myself - ""That's what I need"". After a quick conversation, I was picking up Sam from across the town. The one thing that caught my attention, was how delighted were Sam owners when they handed me the leash. I didn't think about it until we get home. At first I thought Sam was just stressed and it was the reason behind his lack of intention to get out of the car. I quickly discover that in fact he is lacking intention to do anything. He didn't like going on walks, playing and in a matter of fact even eating. We made few checkups in nearby vets, but Sam seemed healthy...

I looked online for any clue about his state, but there was little to nothing. That's when I discovered dog psychologist. I took Sam for a consultation, after half an hour we walked with a diagnosis - dog depression. Sam got prescribed some pills and I was instructed to keep him company through all of this. I was worried, but Sam was my only real life friend, so I was not letting him go without a fight. He started attending therapy twice a week, he was taking pills, we even managed to go out for walks sometimes. I wasn't easy, I wasn't taking much care of myself, the only thing that counted was Sam.

I became really attached to him, he was like my family, that's why writing this feels so unrealistic. After seven months of taking care of him, I noticed something growing inside his stomach. He had tumor. Our schedule got even more busy, except of usual routine we started going to the regular vet at least three times a week. I was able to see life slowly leaving his body, day by day.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I guess I wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t as good as I thought.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ýýt forever. Just for a little while, until you figure out what you did and feel properly contrite. Though I must say, even down here this is a littleýýýunusual.ýýý

She sipped her coffee, I sipped my tea. A couple blustered in out of the cold and I saw the river framed behind them, that lazy flow. The couple were both wearing Christmas sweaters and big colorful socks, matching pairs, and they shivered against each other for a moment as they took in their surroundings. Their faces were completely blank, two beige discs moving this way and that, before settling on each other.

ýýýUnusual how?ýýý I asked.

Death considered me. ýýýWell, you know that clichýý about beauty being in the eye of the beholder? Pain is that way too. Most things are, but pain is singular. Hit me and Iýýýll cry, hit a boxer and theyýýýll blink. Get used to a specific brand of pain and it becomes an echo. And yet, everyone has, at their core, something that hurts them the most.ýýý

She gestured to the door. ýýýIf you could go out there and walk down the river for a while, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d find a billion variations of this cell. Oh, you have all the classical imagery, torturers and whatnot, others that are simple isolation, simulated drownings, a breakup frozen in time forever--or until the lesson starts to sink in. But regardless of their differences there's a person in each one, trapped in their own individual hell.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Death sipped her coffee again. Giggled into the steam. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yours is the only Hell Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever seen with flowers.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ah,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said. I looked down into my teacup and found it empty. Cold. I told her that I understood.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Then explain it to me,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What could be so bad about a coffee shop?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Another specter drifted forward, drifted back. I cradled fresh warmth in my hands and cleared my throat. In life, I had never been very used to speaking.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It exists,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s normal. All these people with all these lives, takinu with your tea,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Exactly. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all the things I never understood. I used to come here sometimes, just to remind myself of that. Sit in this chair and watch the world go by.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

There was Deathï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sad smile again. No teeth, just a gesture of the lips and a painful warmth behind her eyes.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And me?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she asked. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I look different to every person. Whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s this girl to you?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No one,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Bullshit,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death said.

I drank my tea. Watched the doors open and close. Shapes moved along the river, came up out of the fog. From time to time a scream cut through the cafeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s quiet murmur, but that was all, and that was all there ever would be.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Who am I?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death asked again.

And I shrugged. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½One of the baristas. Just someone who was kind.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

When I looked back Death was gone, and in her place sat a faceless girl. The same band tee and leather jacket, the same vanrs.",3700,Human-Advanced

""I mean it's kinda warm but only in the sunlight those. The shade from those willow trees looks comfy though."" I said walking over.

The demon chasing after me and exclaimed ""those are geysers of molten lava not weeping willows!""

Before I could reach them the demon ran in front of me and blocked my path.

""Here hold this"" they said while handing me the most beautiful diamond. Shinning so brilliantly that it seemed to produce the light rather than reflecting it.

""WHAT!!! That is a ball of smoldering coal!"" Stamping their foot in disgust.

One of the people began crying ""if only I had seen sooner there is so much I could have done around here!!!""

""I know right. when did we get a spa?"" Said a middle aged man wiping what appeared to be soot off his clothes.

""Whoa an angel!"" Exclaimed a child who was using the diamond in a game of catch with some other children.""

""I've never seen one with black feathered wings before."" A woman carrying an infant said walking up to the demon. ""I'd like to file some complaints. Why have we been here so long but not allowed to use these public amenities?""

""What!! There is nothing but pain and suffering here! Even if we had anything like that it wouldn't be 'Public'.""

""That sign right there by the pool says 'For public use. For service call (666)555-3146'."" I said. Reading the sign to the demon.

This place didn't seem like the Hell that was depicted by everyone. The scenery was as if it were a utopia, and the people were full of glee. It was as if it were a vacation that would cost a lot, but all it took was my death.

The streets were being roamed by those who also ended up in Hell. People who did bad deeds. Albeit that, they still ended up in such a beautiful place. This couldn't have been real.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Child, what made you think this was heaven?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A person in front of me appeared and I flinched backwards slightly. They came out of nowhere. Their tone and their choice of wording could only make me conclude that this was, in fact, a demon. There was nothing that truly defined them. They seemed very androgynous, and so was their voice. Hair cut to their chin, and plain clothes that you would see on an extra in a high school movie. A blank white shirt, light colored jeans, and a black pair of Converse scuffed up with wear and tear.

A sheepish look waon my face as I looked at the being in front of me.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This isn't exactly what I was expecting Hell to be like.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The only way I had heard of the afterlife was Heaven and Hell, and that Heaven would be a place where you could live out your afterlife with joy and nothing wrong with you, and Hell would be a place where there would be screams filling your ears, being mercilessly tortured. This wasn't like that at all.

The being's eyes trailed over my face, and then I saw what the otherworldly features were on these demons. The black eyes that really showed the void in the world were the most notable, other than the tiny horns protruding between the being's hair. At the base, it was the person's skin tone, although it faded the farther it got up into a dusty red color. I didn't doubt that there could be more signs, but it was all that caught my eyes.

The being's pale hand was extended, as if I were to take it. Reluctantly, I did. The flowing sensation that I could only describe as anguish filled mrenaline raced throughout my body as all I saw was what could be seen as static. Ringing filled my ears, along with distant screams that we're relentless. They got louder and louder, only then taking the form of the people I knew before my death.

Mumma. She was yelling at me, disappointed for how I was failing with my grades, and yet again me not finding a job. She truly believed I refused to get a job as a sign of disobedience.

Dadda. He was an alcoholic, and his words slurred into the familiar argument of me becoming a failure. He would encourage horrible things, and often yell for my removal from this household.

I forced my eyes open, beginning to see what took the form of demons crowding me angrily, ready to cause my greatest fears to become true. An afterlife full of torment.

And then the grasp left my hand, and I could finally breathe. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and the ringing in my ears stayed consistent. My eyes slowly looked up to see the being with a finger across their mouth, a coy smile spread across their face.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This place is only nice on the outside, child.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

It seemed as if the being was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving only the reminisce of smoke in their wake. My jaw clenched anxiously with the thought of this afterlife. There was no way for me to die again, as I was already dead.

""You must be her father. I see. Where is Anabelle?""

""No, no, I'm the one asking questions. Who the fuck do you think you are?"" I snarled.

The delicate eyebrows of the Moon Goddess furrowed gently. ""That's not an appropriate tone-"" she attempted to chide.

I barked in harsh laughter, interrupting her. ""Like hell it isn't! I have half a mind to smash this thing right now! Only reason I haven't already is because Annie begged me to at least talk to you first. So talk.""

The Moon Goddess sighed and smoothed her far-too-sheer dress. ""I'm glad Moon Warrior Anabelle is well. What did she tell you?""

""She told me enough,"" I said. ""She told me that this gem thing basically turns her into a superhero to fight the, what did she call it?""

""Yeah, that. Makes people into monsters. You have my daughter fighting goddamn monsters!"" I shouted. ""What's wrong with you?""

""What's wrong, sir, is that I've been sealed away from the Earth, unable to protect it. People are dying. Your world will fall under the Shadow if nothing is done,"" she said, limpid eyes imploring me.

But I was unmoved. ""One of those people could by Annie,"" I said. ""This is wrong. Why her?""

""Only those with love in their heart, pure and true, could hear my call. Your Anabelle answered. She recognized the threat posed by the shadow. She is a remarkable girl.""

""I know,"" I said quietly. I thought hard. ""You said those with a pure heart could hear you, but I can hear you now. What's different?""

""You have a Moonstone, one of five that I could create. It allows our connection and allows me to transform Anabelle into a Moon Warrior,"" she explained.

""Would it only work on Annie?"" I asked.

The Moon Goddess pondered a moment. ""I suppose not. After all, you can reach me with it. But the user's love must be pure and burn bright, or else the Shadow will defeat you.""

I nodded grimly. ""Believe me, Moon, a father's love definitely burns bright. Annie's not going to fight for you anymore. I'm taking her place as Moon Warrior Dan.

My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.

""Molly."" I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.

""Molly!"" I yell this time.

""Hello."" I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. ""I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother.""

""I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?"" I ask, trying to control my own voice.

""I am the night.""
""Where's Molly?"" I say again.

""I said, I am the night!"" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. ""I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves.""

I roll my eyes. ""Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!""

""She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side.""

I stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.

""Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant."" I yell.

""I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . .""
I cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.

""She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job.""

""College?"" The moon goddess pauses. ""College?"" She croaks.

""Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history."" Please not art history, I think.

""Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?"" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.

I shake my head. ""NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way.""

""She doesn't know how to fight evil?"" The moon goddess asks.

""NO!"" I scream. ""Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!""

I take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink.

""Yeah, sorry."", I replied. ""Bella is a bit busy right now explaining things to her mother. I swiped this from her while she was distracted."" I hold out the golden, cresent moon locket in question to this lady.

""This important?"" I asked.

""That is not yours to use,"" the woman spoke sternly. She looked young, but that glare she was giving me gave me the impression she was older than she let on.

""Hm? Why not? Worked just fine a moment ago. By the way, nice place. The room really gives off that magical girl vibe,"" I gesture around to the pink room full of cutesy decorations and soft fabrics.

""You aren't worthy to be one of my princess warriors. Return it to Isabella immediately.""

""Or what?"" I hung the locket in front of me from my hand. Silence follows and I could see the gears in her head ticking. Not used to someone saying no, eh?

""That's what I thought. So, let me cut to the chase. I have questions and something you want. You have answers. Let's negotiate, shall we? Know how that works?""

If looks could kill, this lady would have murdered me dead. ""I have nothing to say to you.""

I shrug. ""That so? Well then, answer me this then. Do you know in what condition Bella is in right now after doing one of YOUR errands?""

The lady shifted inquisitively, but stayed quiet.

""Multiple lacerations. Black eye. Fractured bones. And, let's not forget, the multiple people who are now in the hospital because of that thing she fought."" Anger was slipping into my voice. The lady didn't react. Good. She isn't watching my other hand. The one NOT holding the locket.

""So, I want you to tell me, in explicit detail, of why the hell a 14 year old girl is doing your dirty work? Cause either you tell me, or I will-.""

Tylerýýýs father had taught him many things in life. The handshake thing, sure. Something about never trusting a fart after Tijuana Tuesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½another truism Tyler would need to modernize. But one of the most important things Tylerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s father had taught him was this:

If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re caught in a bad situation, always be the craziest one in the roomï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no one wants to mess with crazy.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You heard right,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Tyler quietly. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We must be lovers. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re already in my bedroom, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re holding my hand, whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s next, my sweet underbed lurker? What will we do with all this pent upï¿½ï¿½ï¿½energy?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler extended his index finger and began to lightly stroke whatever it was that he was holding.

Tyler heard muffled grunts as the being struggled to release itself from his grip. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stop! Stop!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Shouted the voice. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Tyler held strong. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dude? What a cute pet name for me. I think Iï¿½s nto.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Tyler felt the being below him thrash about under his bed, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s body slammed against the underside of his box spring and rang loudly throughout the quiet house. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Seriously, dude. Let me go!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Said the voice. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I promise, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll leave, just let me go.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The voice sounded scared. Desperate.

Now it was Tylerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s chance to put to practice another of his fatherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s wise words:

If you ainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t gonna eat it, let it go quick.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I always was more of a catch and release fisherman,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You be good now, though. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to hear about you holding hands with other lovers around town, honey. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a jealous man,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler said.

He loosened his grip and let go. Tyler heard the sound of claws against his hardwood floor as whatever it was scurried away as fast as it could.

Shortly after falling back to sg back at him.

Jamal's smile turns into a devilish smirk as he sees the visage his father puts on as a hero vanishes. Jamal then watches as the amulet around his father's neck glows like before as he speaks some strange archaic language.

But, as his father's muscles tense up to throw his son back onto the roof, Jamal snatches the glowing amulet from his father's neck and rips it free.

Suddenly, his father loses his strength and collapses as his son, who was dangling over the ledge of the building falls.

Jamal smiles as he falls. The building is tall, but the fall is mere seconds. Shouting to the amulet in his hand, he recites the same words he's heard his father speak to it, the words Jamal has spent hours memorizing over recordings of his father's battles.

Suddenly, the amulet glows as it recognizes the voice of it's new master. Jamal's fall ceases and he simply floats there. It feels like he's being cradled in a massive and invisible hand. He then looks up towards the top of the building as his father looks down in disbelief.

Jamal flies back up the building to his dad as he stands atop the invisible force that lifts him.

""H-how? The amulet...it requires someone of blood relation. But you can't-""

Jamal laughs, his outburst interrupting his fathers disbelief.

""Really?! Do you think that it's so impossible? That your youth would never catch up to you? Welcome to the real world, Dad! Your actions have consequences...and just like you made me live without something, I'm going to make you suffer the same!""

Jamal then flies closer to his father as he can tease him with a whisper, making sure to stay just out of arms reach.

""The look on your face. You can hardly believe it yet the proof is right in front of you. I'm surprised you didn't see it before, but then again, nature versus nurture, right? I was forced to become stronger than you, and now you'll get to see that in full. So, about me taking something from you...this amulet is mine now. But don't you worry, I'm not just taking something from you, I'm also giving you something. You have a son now~""

Jamal's smile is wide and eyes crazed as he points his father's gaze to a nearby holoboard (holographic billboard used on building in the city). On the board is an article (created by Jamal's friend with the radio control) that is just being released saying not only that Hexing's true identity is Kobi Shepard, but that his son is Jamal Shepard, the new villain who's named himself Gozer.",371,Human-Intermediate

In order to talk to him, you become a villain.","""Do we really have to do this?"" The junior officer asked as they trotted down the hall next to their senior.

""Kid, if it were me I'd have kicked them back out on the street already. This guy was way too keen on pressing his luck though. Obviously wanted to be here, weirdly enough..."" The gruff older cop responded, clearly more exasperated by the circumstance than anything else.

It did not help that for some reason the local superhero, Obelisk, had taken a sudden interest in a crime such as this. The two officers stood with trepidation as they entered the lobby of the precinct and greeted the waiting hero.

""I hope I'm not impeding your work."" Obelisk offered in a deep stoic tenor.

The older cop simply waved the notion away with a dismissive hand. ""No, no. just paperwork day in and out for me any ways, your per is this way.""

The officers led the imposing figure of a hero back down the hall they had just left drop, retracing their steps back to the interrogation room. No sooner had the superhero entered the room than the older cop turned to leave.

""Where you going?"" The younger cop asked with a clear tone of confusion, his head flipping between the door to the observation room and back to his coworker.

""I couldn't be paid to care, if anything does come of that conversation, I can't imagine it being related to any case I'd touch with a ten foot pole if a super is involved."" Is all the older cop gave as he continued his retreat towards the break room.

The younger cop gave one last glance at the observation room door, his eyes lingering on it as his curiosity hung in the air. He eventually let out a sigh as he turned to head to the break room as well.

Inside the dim interrogation room the atmosphere was different. Tense. Obelisk stood over the criminal with an unreadable stare from beneath the obfuscating mask, his muscular arms braced against the table as if he were about to squash it like an accordion. The perp sat in the chair with a glare of his own, smugly defiant in the face of just an imposing presence.

The silence lingered for far too long as the two stared each other down. It was just one word that eventually broke the silence.

""Really.""

An eyebrow raised on the criminal, a smug grin forming across their face.

""Yeah?""

""Really.""

""Yeah, really.""

The threatening posture of Obelisk melted into a slump as he continued staring, a hand moving up to massage his face.

""Glenn, you know you could have just called me."" Obelisk says with a heavy dose of frustration.

""Oh, really?"" The criminal retorts with a snap. ""Check your damn phone old man! Who do you think I sent my call to? Figure it's only after the cops contacted you did you set this up.""

The perp leaned back in his chair, kicking his feet up onto the table.

""I know my work can keep me busy often, but you know better than this Glenn. I raised you better than this.""

""Your maid raised me better than this.""

An audible crick can be heard from the table as Obelisk's hand clutches it tightly, the snapping of the wood surface in his grasp causing amusement to play across the criminal's face.

""Look, can we talk about this later at home? I have to track down a lead and-"" Obelisk begins to ask tensely, his weighty tenor laced with an unsteady warble. The criminal cuts the superhero off however, letting out a long ""PFFF!"" as he drops his feet off the table and lets the chair slam back forward.

""Later! It's always later! What's it gonna take for it to be now!"" He shouts out at Obelisk, sending the hero into a backpedal.

""Look son, I really have to-""

""Yeah I get it. The lives of strangers matters more than your son.""

""...Look Glenn, I know it's tough with me not being around too often, but what I do is important. Don't throw your life away over this. What I do is really important and there are many people's lives I have to look out for.""

The air of strength seemed to have drained from Obelisk as he now stood, looking towards the estranged perp glaring at him from the table. The criminal in turn stood defiantly.

""Fine! Go do whatever you gotta. You know were I'll be? HERE! Because it's the only place in the world where you've given me the time of day. If I gotta be a criminal just for you to give me a second thought, then it doesn't matter how much gum it takes!""

jb4iusp,If someone dies in a horrific or traumatic way they are not greeted by Charon the ferryman but instead by Cerberus the best therapy dog in the whole underworld.,"After the accident, I wake to the feeling of dogs licking my face. I throw my arm across my face and roll onto my front. As I brought a knee up to stand, I am bumped over by a large enthusiastic dog siding up to my left with the speed of puppy hood. You know how a happy dog can feel like a lot of dogs? This dog feels that way. The dog turns back. I get a good look at it for the first time right as it jumps up to continue its attempt to lick my face.

The dog has three heads.

""Down!"" I say, trying to turn my head to avoid the French kiss that dogs seem to aim for. I am just bearly successful. It has a head licking me from both sides and front.

I bring an arm up from trying to push the dog's body back to cover my mouth as I command, ""Down!""

It works this time. The dog drops onto my feet and attempts to roll up my legs. It is rolling over to show me his belly; one head looking to at me with pleading eyes. One head tries to push it over farther onto me. One head is licking its head looking at me. I reach down to start scratching the dog's/ dogs' belly.

I look around as I kept scratching the dog(s). Maybe it is just one dog? The dog and I are on the shore of a river. There is a person working on a small boat. He is a ways down the shore.

""Hey!"" I call to the boater, ""I like you dog!"" The worker waves an arm to me in acknowledgement, but then continues to ignore me.

My thoughts grow from just focusing on the dog to... oh my God! The car accident! Did everyone get out?! I remember the accident. I remember reaching through broken glass unbuckling the kid from a car seat. I remember diving through a shattered driver's side window, reaching for the buckle trying to get the driver loose. I remember the impact of another car as I was trying to get back out the window.

I start sobbing. The dog squirms back over to its feet. It sits in front of me. Two heads hang low, with eyes looking up at me. The center head gives a couple tentive licks. My chin. My cheek.

I feel overwhelmed my fear. Sadness. I failed. I died.

I burry my head between two of the dog's; the crook warm and musky. I wrap my arms up and around its large body. As The sobs slowly subside, the dog starts to squirm. I let him go from my tight, desperate embrace.

He runs to the boat man and back to me. The boat man follows the dog my way.

I turn away to dry my face. Then stare at the water quietly lapping the muddy shore.

""He is Cerberus. He loves everyone. Did you want to give him a couple treats?"" Says the man as he comes closer.

""Yes!"" I say finally looking the man in his face.

He smiles kindly and drops three dog treats and an old coin into my hand.

""Cerberus is silly, you can't just feed one head or he sits there drooling at you with all three."" The man explains.

He looks away from me and asks, ""Do you have a coin to pay the ferryman?""

I feed Cerberus his three treats.

""I do."" I tell the man handing him his coin back.

He leads me to the boat. Cerberus runs through the water's edge and back up onto the bank. All three of us climb into the boat.",475,Human-Advanced
jb4e5gy,If someone dies in a horrific or traumatic way they are not greeted by Charon the ferryman but instead by Cerberus the best therapy dog in the whole underworld.,"Cerberus sensed a familiar scent in the underworld; a regular visitor who had always sought his companionship when he came by. He eagerly ran past Hades to greet an old friend, who typically had an aromatic, earthy smell of citrus and spice. But today he smelt of blood and burns.

For Hades, this was a worrying sign. He had been planning for a few years on how to bring up the topic of these recurring visits by a member of a foreign pantheon. The frequency of these visits had been increasing at an alarming rate for these past few years.

Near the gates of the underworld, Hades was greeted by the sight of Cerberus licking terrible wounds from a strange creature with 6 scorched, blackened wings and numerous eyes, half of which were oozing blood.

""Greetings, King Hades, I apologize for taking up Cerberus, but he has been the best therapy dog I've ever met in the various pantheons. He has proven instrumental in helping me to maintain my sanity.""

""Explain, I rarely venture beyond the underworld due to how busy it can get, but I need to know why you are here for the 6th time this month. What in your world is going on? Who did this to you?"" Hades enquired.

""My accursed brother...after serving his sentence of a thousand years, restarted the war between the Fallen and our kind. He seems to take perverse pleasure in repeatedly murdering me and mutilating my vessels.""

""You Abrahamic angels have a healer among your kind, your repeated intrusions into my underworld just to see Cerberus for therapy is unwarranted. Go to Raphael if you have to. Good thing he can heal all kinds of wounds and mental illnesses, isn't it?""

""But I am Raphael...everyone in Heaven keeps saying it is a good thing I can heal, but I have been pushed beyond my limits. These recent deaths I have suffered are horribly traumatic. These wounds do not heal instantaneously. Please, I need time.""

Cerberus snuggled up to the angel, who still has his injured wings curled around the dog in a tight embrace.

Hades sighed, ""How long will you need Cerberus? I can tell he is very fond of you, but do not overstay your welcome.""

""I will only stay for a few days. I will leave when my physical vessel has fully reformed and I am alive again. I will not loiter unnecessarily. Like you, I have much work to do as well, I have to heal so many innocents who have been wounded and injured because of Lucifer's futile, senseless war.""

Hades pondered for a moment before replying. This issue about Raphael hogging so much of Cerberus' therapy time had to be addressed urgently.

""You can stay here for all your therapy needs with Cerberus, for as long as you need to be fully functioning. You will be welcome if you need his therapy services again, for as long as Lucifer continues to be a massive douchebag.

Meanwhile, I am going to have a stern word with your father NOW.""",271,Human-Intermediate
jba33np,If someone dies in a horrific or traumatic way they are not greeted by Charon the ferryman but instead by Cerberus the best therapy dog in the whole underworld.,"I gotta say, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld is not the first thing I expected to see after getting my head blown off.

But when I awoke, Cerberus was standing over me, all three heads licking my face. I pushed the middle one away and said sternly, ""Off.""

All three heads stopped licking me as Cerberus stood up straight, staring at me curiously. The middle head was panting, and his tail was slowly wagging.

""Do you want... pets?"" I said, wiping dog slobber off my face.

Cerberus's tail wagged faster, and the other two heads panted excitedly. He got into a playful stance and jumped, shaking the ground when he landed. I walked up to him, and he leaned his middle head forwards as if to say, Yes, please pet me.

I gently stroked the head, and it gave me a single lick. ""Aww, you like that, don't you?"" I said in a playful voice.

I booped the middle head's snoot, and Cerberus excitedly panted and jumped again, shaking the ground. I walked under his belly and said, ""Do you like belly rubs?""

I rubbed his belly once before Cerberus flopped down and rolled over onto his back, flailing his legs and wagging his tail in excitement. I climbed onto his belly and rubbed again, causing all three heads to let out simultaneous excited barks.

""You having fun, Cerby?"" said a voice.

I looked to where the voice had came from and saw Charon, the Underworld's ferryman, walking towards us. His boat was parked at the dock of the River Styx, where I saw a few other spirits boarding.

""I see he has taken a liking to you, young mortal,"" said Charon. ""As he does with everyone, I suppose.""

He reached into his pocket, took out three large dog treats, and handed them to me as I climbed off of Cerberus's belly. ""Make sure you feed all three heads at once,"" Charon explained, ""or else he may not like you as much anymore.""

I tossed a treat to each head as Cerberus stood back upright. I could tell they excited him, as all three heads began licking my face again.

""Aack! Off, Cerberus, off!"" But my commands were no use this time, as he simply kept licking.

""Heel, Cerberus,"" Charon ordered. Cerberus stopped licking, sat down, and studied me curiously again. But soon, all three heads yawned, and he flopped down on the ground and fell asleep, making cute but loud snores.

""Food always makes him sleepy,"" said Charon. ""Even little treats. Come on, let's get you on the boat.""",4,Human-Novice
ji6detn,"You're an astronaut sent on a solo deep space mission. To combat the loneliness, you've created an imaginary friend who you interact with every day. Upon finally returning, mission control stops you. An unidentified lifeform has been detected on your ship.","Day 189: Space is surprisingly empty. There's a reason it's not called 'full'. The ship's automation pretty much continues to do all of the fun stuff. Collecting data, scanning planets, searching for life. So far my job as a glorified maintenance man has culminated in a wildly exciting five minutes of clearing a rogue chunk of space rock from the main sensor. So much for my dreams of fame and renown as 'Captain Jefferies' of the U.S.S Pinkerton.

Day 233: The computer won't talk to me anymore. I think I accidentally offended it. How was I to know it was sensitive about not having parents? The silence is deafening. I feel as though I'm becoming trapped within my own mind. Some days I wonder if space truly is just a lifeless void, echoing my loneliness back to me.

Day 355: I made a friend today. The computer hasn't said a word in months. It's still functioning perfectly so I can only assume that is a personal choice. Luckily Bob is highly talkative. Turns out we have almost everything in common. He likes 90s pop punk just like me. His favourite movie is Armageddon. He hates reading (honestly why would you sit and read words when you could watch magic unfold in real time). He's the perfect guy.

Day 412: Bob told me the best joke today. I daren't repeat it on the record but I was in stitches. I had to really try hard not to wet myself, the last thing I needed was trying to clean that up in zero g. He has such a good sense of humour. I have to say though, his smiles never quite seem to meet his eyes.

Day 590: We should be returning to sub station 14 soon. Only a few more months to go. I asked Bob what he would do once we got home. His reply, ""I am home."". He's such a good friend. Almost like a brother to me at this point. Part of me worries that he will remain on the ship after the mission ends. I hope he will come with me though. I don't care what anyone says, he saved my life up here. I owe him.

Day 630: Less than 100 days to go now. The time has really started to fly now that we're in the home stretch. Bob's gotten awfully quiet. We don't quite have as much fun together as we used to. I don't think he's looking forward to leaving. I think I'm going to ask him to come and live with me. He needs to know that the space he has filled will revert to a Bob sized hole in my heart if he leaves.

Day 721: We should have disembarked by now. Instead we've been put on indefinite hold by mission control. Bob seems nervous. I told him that everything will be fine. I wish I could convince myself.

Day 730: Mission control made contact today. ""We can't let you dock. We've got two life sign readings here,"" They told us. I tried to explain that it was because of both Bob and myself. They didn't understand though. They asked to speak to Bob but he was sleeping. I told them to try again tomorrow.

Day 731: A shuttle approaches. They're coming. Bob betrayed me. I shouldn't have let him speak to mission control. It seems that they know him. Captain Bob Jefferies they called him. They asked lots of questions. He didn't tell them we were friends. He didn't explain how close we'd become. How we had saved each other. Instead he spoke lies of an alien entity commandeering his ship. Of being held hostage for most of the mission. Of me.

Day 740: Bob can't speak anymore. None of them can. They came to kill me. But nobody can kill me. I don't understand. I only came because of their message. They called for me. Asked for others to seek them out. I hear others calling now. A thousand voices from millions of lightyears away calling for signs of life. For proof they're not alone in an empty universe.

Wilson looked at me sideways, but still sang, albeit in a half-whisper. ""Something something, skiddly diddly doo.""

Wilson, please!""

He went silent, but I could practically hear him continue the song mentally as his head bobbed to the beat. It was distracting as I tried inputting an intricate series of code into the holoscreen at my wrist.

I sighed, giving up on the task for a moment. ""You shouldn't be so excited, you know. Earth is a cesspool now. Filled with parasites. Humans, just sucking the life out of the planet.

Wilson looked out the window dreamy-eyed. ""I can't wait to suck life out of the planet. You should try some."" He turned back to me. ""In the meantime, lighten up. It's a good day. You'll be home in minutes.""

""That's not my home,"" I said, and I meant it. The decades in deep-space had changed me. My ship's communications system had malfunctioned without reason or warning, stranding me alone in the deep black. Those years threatened to consume me entirely. I was lost, without hope, on the verge of self-termination, a failure to my people. Then came Wilson. It all changed with Wilson. He gave me the thing I needed most: guidance.

So melodramatic,"" he said. ""Whats the first thing youll eat when youre back?

I shrugged. Food wasnt on my mind.

""Come on. A burger? A pizza? Two burgers?""

""The first thing you said,"" I muttered, typing in a very precise set of codes.

Churros for me. You like Churros?

Never had it.

Never had a churro! Wilson exclaimed, looking at me with concern. You know what a churro is though, right?

Yes.

What is it?

I need to focus.

On what? The ship does all the work, he slapped the ship's controls clumsily. A light went on. Whoops, he flipped a switch and the light turned off. See? Easy."" His eyes narrowed as he noticed what had been preoccupying me. ""What are you messing with on your wrist? A watch?

It's nothing, I said. ""Tell me more about churros.""

It was as if I had asked him to tell me about his dead mother. He didn't stop talking for what felt like an hour, getting choked-up and teary-eyed at parts. It wasn't until the ship started shaking and roaring that he snapped back to the present. And those notes of cinnamon and fried dough, they don't just go away. No, they linger both physically and mental--Wait! Were through the atmosphere! This is it! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven

Is that necessary?

Of course it's necessary! We're astronauts, we count-down! It's what we do! Three! Two! Oneeeee! The ship continued decelerating and Wilson drew the syllables out as long as he could. ""Zeeeerrrooooooooo--""

With a roar, the ship shuddered to a stop. They had landed.

Timed to a tee."" Wilson said. ""They'll shit themselves finding two of us in here, eh?""

Theyll only find one of us, I sighed, feeling almost guilty. But now that we had landed, I didn't need Wilson anymore. I pressed a button on what Wilson referred to as my ""watch.""

""Where'd you go?"" He said suddenly. Before he could say anything else, the ships doors opened and a crowd of armed men rushed in, clad head-to-toe in rubber. They ignored me and threw a metallic blanket over Wilson.

Whats going on?! I heard Wilson yell from underneath. The men had grabbed his arms and were escorting him from the ship.

Hey Tod, I bet that things malfunctioning too! We should head back!

""You probably think that last part is a joke but trust me; one glimpse into a horse and you won't be right for a week.""","A rabbit spasmed in my arms, its white legs twitching as I held it snugly. It had fallen from a brick wall, and in its eyes, I saw tremendous fear. Such a terror was the worst enemy of these creatures, they could become afraid enough that it could kill them outright. I could heal the wounds to its legs, but I could not restore it from the grave. My instinct was wholly to save it, and the wise words of my mentor were lost on me when I entered its mind; all I wanted to do was calm its nerves, to comfort it, as we would all wish to be comforted.

Through the doorway I expected the emotions of a shivering child; tears and screams. Instead, there was nothing but bright white. In the pointed center of my vision, I saw a gold dot. As I walked closer, it took on the form of a golden ring. When I stood in front of it, I could see a pale translucent red material in the middle. Only when it blinked did I realize it was an eye.

I gasped and stepped back, reaching for my wand in my pocket but realizing that I had no form. This was strange, for I always had a form in my subjects.

Then the eye turned an opaque gray. Shapes came from the edges and began to coalesce. The first thing I noticed was the jade color of my boots, then the rest of the castle garden came into focus. My feet were swinging back and forth like the pendulum of a clock. I was so entranced in the image that I almost didn't see words forming outside of the eye in the whitespace. ""Elves are so difficult to work with."" ""Argh!"" ""Why did that wand cost me an extra two gold?""

Strange, I thought, for these were clearly my own thoughts. How?

The more they appeared, the more I realized that the rabbit knew absolutely everything about me. Nothing was spared, from my deepest fantasies to my most banal mutterings about the weather.

But... It couldn't be the rabbit. I'd never seen it before, I just encountered it while I was... sitting on the wall. It stumbled, then fell, then I leaped after it to save it. How was this possible? Where were the emotions? The terror? The scared little bunny whom I was about to save?

The scene on the wall played back in my mind again and again, and as it did, it slowly occurred to me that things might not have happened the way I thought. Who fell first? Did I fall first? Could the rabbit have leaped... to save me? No, not at all possible. Rabbits don't possess that kind of intelligence.

Or do they?",612,Human-Advanced
jhlrfd8,"""There are three rules for mind-readers..."" The man speaks sternly. ""Don't read loved ones, don't reveal your powers, and NEVER try to read animals."" He shivers a bit. ""You probably think that last part is a joke but trust me; one glimpse into a horse and you won't be right for a week.""","Gulping lightly, She looked at his pale blue eyes. Searching for help through occultist and new age foruns proved fruitless, a myriad of people searching for ghosts and freaks were they are not. Until, mysteriously, She stepped on the man's path. Terry felt another thought inside her skull, asking for how long could she read what other people were thinking.

Jumping, and making a scene in the small library, Terry took a look at the man with balding grey hair and unkempt beard. A stereotype of a mystic, almost a modern day Rasputin. He introduced himself as Virgil, and invited the girl for a coffee.

""We are anomalies."" He said, monotonously; the way his face changed, one almost saw a smirk under the thick moustache. ""Born on the brink of extinction and, as someone once advised me...""

""You now pass the set of rules for me."" Concluding the line of thought. ""Have your mentor explained the why of these rules?""

The man showed some teeth, in a surprisingly warm smile.

""Ah... indeed, talented minds indeed.""

He looked through the window, towards the cloudy sky, and took another sip of the coffee from his white mug.

""You not only can read thoughts, but also search for them."" He began, the smile fading away. ""One day, you can be on a happy married life, then your curiosity wins. Suddenly, your wife is thinking about divorce; your husband is having an affair with the neighbour and your kids are not yours. Or worse, your mother regrets not having an abortion when she had the chance."" He put his gaze back at yours. ""You'd be surprised at how many readers prefer death over life with this information.""

She took the mug to her lips but did not drink the hot beverage. The information was enough to digest.

""And I guess, the second rule is because I don't want to spend the rest of my days as a test subject.""

The man silently nodded.

""What about the third rule?""

""It's better to take my word for it.""

His words were not enough. In her apartment, Terry laid on a small couch with a blanket covering her legs, her gaze fixed in Pandora. A white cat, between six and eight years old. She laid on a rug, with the tail covering herself, almost making her look like a pillow. With the silence on the house, her purring could be heard from their distance. She appeared mysteriously on a walk a few blocks to the right.

What could be so terrible in the mind of a cat? An eldritch horror? Some sophisticated thoughts?

Taking a deep breath. The reader felt the familiar sensation. Imagine that your mind is extending an arm and touching a box. You can feel its smoothness and sharp corners. All you have to do is... open.

No voice, or thought, erupted in her mind. Rather, it was like a film. A dream where you're vividily paid attention to your surroundings. Everything was so large, or, maybe, she was so small. The floor was close to her view, almost as if she was laying on it directly, made of mahogany. She wanted to look around, to move her neck, but she couldn't. The view of the floor kept for a full minute. Until a creaking sound made itself known. Terry felt the tension course through her body.

With heavy steps, there was a man. He was wet, or maybe sweaty? His rugged features and black hair weren't strange... from memory, he could be the butcher or the baker, that she saw whenever she had to do groceries. Something moved in her back, and then, from her mouth, a low hissing sound came.

She wasn't Terry, right now. Well, not only Terry.

The man looked at her and gave a dry chuckle. ""Still mad at me, stupid?!"" He said, without looking at her/them.

He sat on an armchair with thorn tissue, and grabbed his phone. While his thumb scrolled up, he made a shushing sound twice, until looking at them; he moved fast, grabbing a shoe and threw at them.

Pandora's reflexes were good. She dodged easily.

""Big fucking deal. Your kittens were put on a bag"" He said with venom on his voice. ""And I got rid of them, I made sure I did correctly, just so you learn to not act like a slut on my house, got it?""

The movie was interrupted by a brusque sensation that made Terry, the real one, fall on the ground, rolling the blanket on her legs. The sleeping cat, Pandora, woke up startled.

She could not contain the tears in her eyes as she walked closer to the cat and extended her hand towards the animal. That let a small meow escape her mouth and touched the hand with her forehead.

For the rest of the night, Terry stood there, scratching and holding the cat, while sobbing helplessly.",187,Human-Intermediate

""You probably think that last part is a joke but trust me; one glimpse into a horse and you won't be right for a week.""","After that he handed me the pamphlet that described the rules in more detail. ""Ok, I kinda get these rules, you don't want to know what your loved ones think of you, revealing your powers will draw attention, and the way mind reading connects your brain to someone else's makes animals, rough?, That last one doesn't make sense."" I said. He replied ""When you read someone's mind your brain gets a psychic link to them, you think their thoughts and feel their emotions, an animal doesn't think the same way, their minds can be overpowering.""

I went home that day thinking about how toake money off of my new powers, that felt like the most obvious thing to do, but I just couldn't get over the animal part. How in the world does an animals mind overpower a humans, certainly an animal didn't have that kind of mental power. That's when I noticed an ant crawling on my arm. Maybe, just maybe everyone else tried to move too fast, and you just have to work your way up to smarter animals, I could make some money as a dog whisperer, but I had to work my way up.

I focused my power on the ant, the link was a little harder to establish than when I did it with people earlier. A few minutes of focusing and I could feel the mental barrier break and my mind was one with the ant. My heart sank, I felt small and all the curiosity I had flet my soul, in fact all emotion left. I fell over on to the ground, struggling to breathe as my vision started to darken in the corners. I felt the true death of my individuality, all sense of self fleeing me, being unable to truly feel anything I just laid there, breathing heavily, feeling my heart beat.

Hours later I woke up, feeling again. The ant left the range of my telepathy, allowing me to reassure control. I went back to the temple where I learned of my psychic ability when I saw the monk that helped me figure out my abilities. ""You tried an animal, didn't you?"" He said. ""Yeah, I just tried something small to test it, the ant"" I managed to say before being cut off ""An ant!!, Here, you might need this"" he said handing me a business card for a therapist.",5,Human-Novice

I... had the most peculiar of dreams, dear. I- I was a caveman, you see? A proper caveman - like one you'd see in a museum. And I believe a... meteor fell on me? Oh my. I- I might be faint-headed. Say, could you perhaps fetch the physician? I believe he told me to take some of the laudanum if another spell came across me. Take the carriage and bring him right away, will you? Thank you, dear.

My humblest thanks for seeing me, Oracle. I- I need you to beseech Apollo or his noble son, Asclepius, to aid me. I am haunted by the most dreadful visions - visions of lives I've not lived, in the strangest times. Lives that seem to be those of men stuck in the distant past or women in a time so far from now I know not how they could be possible. These visions are... the most vivid you could ever imagine, yet from godhood they are not - it must be a curse. Please, fair Oracle, allow me to beg the Immortals for mercy through you - and, of course, offer a humble offering of drachmae.

168.

There's no other way around it. They're not dreams. Not hallucinations. I've had this thought process far too many times to ignore it. The information I know is far too precise to be coincidental. They're... memories of past lives. Actual past lives. I- I know it sounds impossible, but... modern neuroscience and psychiatry have failed me; is an outlandish explanation such as this not possible? I need a drink.

I've just met a man - a fine young man - today, whose face felt familiar. I first thought him a friend I made during the battle of Tsushima when the Mongols invaded, but no. He was... me. From when I fought in Tsushima before, thousands of lives ago. I didn't know this was possible! That another life could exist in the same time. This is... a most concerning notion. I must meditate on it.

49,862,123,114.

There's nothing here. Nothing except me. It's just... me, over and over again.

I recognize them. So, so many of them - my previous lives, heroes and scoundrels, fair and horrific, and some of them, only a few, recognize me, so... I'm not even the last. I play my parts, I live my lives, compelled by some... primal, unseen drive, forcing me to do things I don't quite want, hurting myself in the past and future, saving them in the next life. But some of them recognize me, leading to one, terrible conclusion - I'm just another member of the chain, the infinite line of lives ahead of me, staring at the line behind me.

As I sit here at the foot of the temple and see a past version of me asking me to beseech Apollo and Asclepius, I can't help but wonder.

Is this Hell?

991,413,761,833.

I'm 47 years into this iteration and it's... promising. I haven't seen a single face I've not seen before; haven't met a single version of me that I don't recall. That - that means that this could be it! At long, long last, this could be...

Focus. Let's see... engines are doing fine, approach vector is perfect. A little shaky but that's to be expected. I'm... anxious. For the first time in what is right next to forever. Gods, it's been billions of years since I've last been anxious. It feels exhilarating!

If the trillions of calculations are correct, I should slip by the event horizon unharmed and fly into the singularity. If the other calculations, the cumulative work of billions of lives working in unison, are also true, then the singularity of this black hole is not a singular point, but a ring. Which means that I could fly through it.

Beyond that, it's a wild guess, even for me. Sometimes I theorised that for information to be preserved past the even horizon, there could be an alternative history, one with the black hole, the other without it - a parallel universe. A place where I could meet someone else.

Or perhaps I'll just get crushed into an infinitely dense point, but maybe - just maybe - I finally won't come back from this one.

And truth be told...

I'm fine with both.",718,Human-Advanced

Billions of lives later, you realise the truth: Every person ever in history is either your past or future reincarnations. There is no one out here apart from you. You are alone.","At first there was nothing, so much nothing, in fact, that the universe was full. Filled to the brim, spilling over with nothingness. A blank slate. Blanker than a slate, blanker than anything that could possibly be imagined and stretching further than a clear night sky. It wasn't that nothing existed, it was that there was nothing to exist.

Then I blinked. I awoke. And then, there was something. It was me, I, the first and only. Now I didn't remember such an event so it could not have been very significant, but nowadays people, other me's mostly, make such a ruckus about it. The ""Big Bang"" they've taken to calling it. Why they went with bang I will never know. Then again, it technically was just another me who had first called it such so something in my brain somewhere felt bang to be an appropriate word. I did not.

Then I died. Another very forgettable event. But apparently I must have enjoyed it because I proceeded to do it again, and again, and again. Some terribly painful: a spear through the chest or lungs full of water; others almost relaxing: in a bed by loved ones or resting in a field. But always the same. Always waking up as a new me until somewhere along the line it was only me. Had only ever been me's.

And suddenly that vast nothingness the universe spilled over with before was replaced and now spilled over with me. Until I could not not see it anymore. After a billion reincarnations it became clear that there was never anything that wasn't me.

George Washington? Me.

That one guy on the Price is Right? Me (hell, and it turns out I was the host too).

That other guy on the Price is Right? Also me.

Something strange happens when one consciousness realizes that everyone is them. It's not like they all realize it as you'd hope, no, in fact they believe the one to be crazy. They pin him to a cross or let him rot beneath a bridge. They label him as crazy and tell him he must see a shrink, a shrink who is also him in disguise beneath a white coat and a degree. And he thinks he is better than me because of his education, but I think I am him because I am.

It all spills over but they cannot see, they do not care. Their throats do not close and their brains do not break, only yours does. And you come to the final realization over and over again, the realization that if everyone is everyone, and everything is everything, that nothing truly ever matters. That maybe it never did. That maybe all of these lives and all of this energy mean nothing in comparison to the true nothingness the universe once had.

The final knowing is that it is easier to be a man than a prophet. Nobody likes a prophet who tells the truth.

So I must keep being a man, every man.

I must enjoy the empire of man, of me, forever. At the very least, I am in good company.",100,Human-Intermediate

You are alone.","It was like ripples on water, expanding outward from that first of my remembered experiences of the world. An expanding remembrance of lives that faded and washed out as more lives where piled on. Memories of lives lived by me but not me until I understood the nature of my existence.

Ad infinitum.

How do I explain that to another iteration of myself? I cant. It is not possible. All those memories I have lived that sticks with me and colours each and every moment of my day now that I understand what they are: billions of a lifetime of memories. Trillions.

I imagine what it would be like to forget.

I remember the life I lived where I came to understand the quality of qualia. That day I came to understand my subjective existence, while almost infinite to me, could not be shared with another version of me. How it had struck me as I walked in the light drizzle of rain, that day in early twentieth century, on an avenue in Cambridge. That moment when I realized that I could not explain my experience to another being because there was no other being.

Just me. Endless versions of me living lives as Time rolled on in a universe that caged me.

It was like this: how do I explain to a blind me what the colour red is if my experiences in that life do not include sight in them?

Then imagine expanding that to encompass trying to explain everything in a life of fifteen years of experiences? Thirty years? Seventy years? One hundred and fifty.

It makes me feel sorry for myself and wish I could just forget.

In this life, I am alone now. The world has died. Every other version of me has escaped back into the past as they had died. That was the only direction I could go when I would come back, reincarnating again as I have since my earliest life remembered. This is the furthest forward I have ever remembered being able to go. The last version of me to be lived.

When I die and come back, it will be to another self back along the line of history.

Ugh.

There had to be a way to brake the cycle. To end this loop. To stop coming back and to embrace the oblivion the weight of all these lives have pushed down on me.

I just want to end the suffering of my lives and the pain of knowing them. I have suffered enough.

My heart stops. Darkness begins to close in on me and all those memories of all those lives lived across thousands and thousands of years rush over my as my mind begins the transition. A sensation both well known and inevitable.

My last thought as I slip away is one that I had not thought before, in all the lifetimes I had live, even the ones in which I had ended my own life.

I just want the suffering to end",2,Human-Novice
