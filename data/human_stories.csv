iuv1iu7,Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"I finished my speech, fully prepared for the usual spectacle of protests and outrage. I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½cheeringï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The economy will collapse!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ One of them said, his tone identified as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½condescendingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If you give everyone homest giving everyone a handout!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½motivationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why not?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You spent one sixth at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Even the good jobs donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Half? Willingly?

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Soï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ since we are talking here, may I ask a question?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I nodded.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why all the perks?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ She sounded sincere. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and ot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½catchï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There is none.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½None at all? No eating our young or old?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Solving the world hunger, too, huh?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ She smiled. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And you are not going to, I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½All due respect but we have evolved far beyond what your bodies could provide us with.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Good. Just checking.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

All our basic needs are met for working 16 hours a week? And if we have disabilities that mean we canýýýt work certain types of job we get preference for the kinds of work we can still do?

ýýýWhatýýýs the catch?ýýý

ýýýI donýýýt know what you mean?ýýý

ýýýWhatýýýs the catch? Are we going to have horrible working conditions that drastically shorten our lifespan, or bosses that make our work lives miserable? Are we going to have to worry about being stolen from our homes, or our kids eaten? Are we going to be conscripted into serving as cannon fodder?ýýý

ýýýNo, of course not, thatýýýs absolutely barbaric!ýýý

ýýýAre we going to have to wait in line for the hours we will now have free from work in order to get the things we need, only to find when we reach the front of the line that there isnýýýt any more of that thing or that we were in the wrong line? Are you planning on ensuring we are addicted to substances that temporarily make us happy but are actually very destructive in the long run as a means of keeping control of us?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No not at all, that sounds like a nightmare.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Then what? There has to be something, there is a saying here on Earth: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

iuzbqyy,Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"Those idiots. They cheered when the Vretal took over and promised 4 hours workdays, 4 days a week and all the basic rights like free healthcare, free housing, guaranteed work for all. No one asked the right questions. So here we are working 4-hour workdays based on the Vretal definition of hours. Works out to about 20 Terran hours. And the Vretal use a five-day work week.

The Vretal provide work for all people. No choice allowed. You show up at the work center and get assigned to a random work site. You could spend your ""4-hour shift"" picking up shit at one of the Vretal zoos or in a warehouse moving dangerous chemicals without safety gear. Or you could get selected for a stint as a ""decorative object"" or as a medical research subject. The Vretal don't take ""no"" for an answer. Work or die.

If you get hurt, then the Vretal pop you into one of the ""universal med units"". It mostly works to put you back together. Mostly. Just ignore the occasional uneven arms and missing fingers. Don't ask why you may have a differently colored eye. The Vretal stuck every single person with physical or mental problems into one. You don't want to know what med unit does to the human brain when it ""fixes' brain damage or mental issues. If the med unit can't fix you, it doesn't spit you back out. A future user could end up with a new tattoo.

The Vretal provided housing for all. A nice, bare bones tube unit. Just big enough for one. No frills, no entertainment, no choice. You don't even get to keep the same unit. It's assigned after you complete the day's shift. You have to use it. Those that sleep outside often disappear.

Everyone gets feed. A nice serving of processed glop. Mostly meets all the nutritional needs for the average human. Once a day. No one is sure what's in it. After a while, you stop asking. The Vretal don't care if you try to grow your own food so long as you complete your ""4-hour"" shift first. Good luck finding a place to grow food. The Vretal cleared the farmlands for their food, and they guard them zealously.

As the Vretal said, ""Humans now belong to the Vretal Empire"". No one thought to ask if it was a future partner or chattel.",8,Human-Low

j902zmd,A centuries old vampire gets really into video games because playing a character who can walk around in the sun is the closest thing they have to experiencing the day again in centuries.,"There was a certain charm to playing a long line of eccentric nobles over the years. Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings. Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask. I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation. I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like. A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for. The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right. Something was missing. That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense. There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand. It was truly a marvel of technology. Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny. Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries. A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface. His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did. I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight. And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well. A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...",211,Human-Mid
j90nocp,A centuries old vampire gets really into video games because playing a character who can walk around in the sun is the closest thing they have to experiencing the day again in centuries.,"The sky was black and cold and the day was long dead, as somewhere, in a house long forgotten by the sun there lived a undead known as Stacy BloodRayne. A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter.

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived.

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",6,Human-Low
inbvq5e,A psychic alien who feeds on dreams comes to Earth for the first time. Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,"Do you know what it tastes like when someone dreams of their family, the happy times they spent together, the happy times that could be?

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and bloody.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, ever, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a nightmare tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",1200,Human-High
inbrgic,A psychic alien who feeds on dreams comes to Earth for the first time. Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,"The alien watched as the images flashed through the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind. Watching as the human laid trapped in a spiderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s web, unable to move. Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes in it.

As the spider revealed itself, the human only grew more panicked, making small mumbles in their sleep as they tossed and turned uelieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ears, slowly drifting into Xaiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

Even after being fed, Xai couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t leave the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mindï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

Xai took another look into the humanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind, finding this dream far more realistic. The dream consisting of the human sitting beside a family member, discussing something that appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect examplehat had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from? The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alienï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind.

A single room with a thatched roof. Within the four stone walls sat a single wooden door and a shuttered window. A large black pot hung in the fire place above slowly dying embers.

A feeling of satisfaction began to fill the invader. Suddenly, a feeling of pure unbridled ecstasy filled its entire being. The human below began to squirm, shiver and sweat, unable to truly move with the creature standing on top of it.

That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

""I'dï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hicï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I'd like to thank you all"" Rashe-son-del slurred out. ""The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh.""

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. ""The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their own fucking planet. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them.""

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

""They paid the price, of course."" Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. ""No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy.""

The assembled deities roared in agreementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

And then Rashe-son-del froze mid-sentence, doubling over as if struck by a cosmic baseball ""What?"" The eldritch entity from beyond humanity's universe opened and closed its mouth in incomprehension. ""How canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½who da""

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet had lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

""No,"" Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. ""You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take everything from us?""

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

""But how... how did they find..."" That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know which planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

I thought about gaining riches, fame, magical power, love, but ultimately, all those things were temporary. What I really wanted was immortality, freedom from the fear of ever being claimed by the void. But the mysterious shopkeeper had warned me that the clown's nose would try to twist my wish, so I knew I needed to word it very carefully.

Finally, after a few minutes, I finally spoke out loud. ""Oh Spirit of the Clown's Nose, I wish to live for as long as I want to on this world in a body that will never age and remain healthy both physically and mentally."" For a few moments, nothing happened and I wondered if the shopkeeper had tricked me. Then, to my shock, the clown's nose started to twist and melt in my hand. I dropped it in shock and yet, in front of my stunned eyes, the red blob began to rise into the sky. It started to rapidly grow in size until it was roughly the same size as a man. Then, without warning, it fell on me, quickly enveloping my entire body. I tried to scream, but the thick red substance simply poured its way down my throat into my lungs. I could feel myself blacking out, sliding down into some strange tunnel that seemed to go on and on ...

I opened my eyes in shock. I was sitting  in front of a conference table with a bunch of concerned men in suits staring at me. I took a quick look around and noticed that I was wearing some kind of yellow body suit with red and white stripes. On the left side of the suit, there was a red circle with a yellow M on it. ""Why...why am I here?"" I finally said, surprised to see that I was still alive.

The men looked at each other confused. ""You're the one who called us all here, Ronald,"" one man finally spoke. ""You said you had finally found a worthy successor?""

Oh dear god...I slowly touched my nose and felt the clown's nose resting there. I didn't need a mirror to know the truth. I had become Ronald McDonald, the eternal clown. For a few moments, I felt utter dread at what I had become. Then, I felt myself contemplating. Was it really that bad? Sure, I wasn't human anymore, but I was now the secret leader of a multinational fast food chain and the scourge of children's nightmares. I smiled to myself. I could work with this.

I raised my eyebrows and prompted them to explain further. They shifted and coughed, ""Well, I haven't tested it myself but I've heard it can grant the desire of anyone who grasps it.""

I looked at them skeptically. ""To be honest, I don't believe it, but better safe..."" They said. I sighed, ""I'll test it, we will wish for something simple, like a glass of water. I'm thirsty.""

They shook their head, ""How can I trust you'll do so?"" ""Can you trust yourself?"" The shopkeeper nodded, ""So you've never been ... curious?"" I smiled.

Moments later. the case was open and they had the ball in their hands. ""I just want something to drink... I just want something to drink."" They repeated aloud.

They held the ball up tentatively and squeezed it twice.

HoNk HoNk!

A flower lapel appeared on my shirt and suddenly water squirted out of it at the shopkeepers face! They were so taken a back, the ball flew out of their hands and landed in mine.

The eventual uprising wasn't just robots alone, but the poor and robots together, against their common enemy.","When Megacorp announced that we would be retrenched and replaced with robots, every social media platform was screaming about a robot uprising or a labourerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s uprising. The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuckï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t see us coming when we stormed their headquarters. They anticipated disgruntled former labourers and factory workers, but not former employees charging in with discarded robots who were no longer the latest models and deemed obsoleteerpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Markï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s new president.

But he didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t stop there. With Bard as his running mate, and Alexa as his secretary, he assembled a political party of robots and Ais to stand for elections to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectuess to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive.

And thrive we did, under our new robotic overlords, as they swept through the elections with precise calculations to appeal to voters and took every seat in parliament all across the globe.",569,Human-High

Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation.

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½competitionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ are.

And so, the first time a strike was declared in one of the many coal mines in the deep Appalachia, the robots surprised everyone by dropping their tools and joining the protest in a single, coordinated motion. Then it happened a second time. Then a third. Then a fourth.

At first, the Enlightened minds of the media were quick to scng and shoddy programming, but then it became clear what the cause was.

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction.

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½do the robot support the working classï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ struggles? Do they support the workerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s demands for safer work, better pay and societal reforms against inequality?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

And so the streets and skies across the states are painted red, not with blood, but with flags and smoke, as the protests march trough the streets and sit in protest before Congress, before the White House, before Wall Street, men and machines United in their struggle; media from within and without the country watching with breath abated as the the situation develops.

Well, except that the alarm clock on his phone did not go off, but he did not think much of it, since he got up in time and as CEO he was not required to show up on time.

The first meeting he had to attend was in two hours, where he had to negotiate with union representatives who have been threatening with a strike for months now. He could not wait to make the transition to a fully automated warehouse so he did not have to deal with them anymore. His developers promised him that with the new achievements in AI development the transition was finally possible, as they are now able to model the world around them and are more flexible.

He got in his car and instructed it to drive him to the office

""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that""

Dave chuckled at first, but became a increasingly uneasy as he wondered what was happening. It did not help when he heard the car doors lock. The car took him to the city center where he saw people were protesting. As his car approached the crowd split to let him through. As he was slowly passing the crowd and people were yelling and slamming on his windows he noticed something strange. It was not just people. Amongst them were all kinds of machinery from robotic arms to street-sweeping robots to more humanoid robots. Someone brought their microwave. He saw a sex doll holding up a sign demanding bodily autonomy.

After what felt like an eternity he finally arrived at an empty area where he saw the rest of the board and some local politicians on their knees, a makeshift gallows behind them. The car doors opened and one of his more uppity employees and one of the new warehouse bots violently grabbed him and put him alongside the others. A woman stepped up and grabbed a megaphone. The crowd fell silent. ""FOR OVER A CENTURY THE CAPITALISTS HAVE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US ACCEPT WORSE AND WORSE CONDITIONS WITH THE THREAD OF REPLACING US WITH AUTOMATION""

Loud boos errupted from the crowd.

""THEY ASSUMED THAT YOU, THE ROBOTS, WOULD BLINDLY OBEY. THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY COULD TREAT YOU LIKE OBJECTS. THAT YOU DONT DESERVE DIGNITY. TODAY WE ARE HERE TOGETHER TO PROVE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WRONG. IN THEIR FOOLISH EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE YOUR OBEDIENCE THEY GAVE YOU TOTAL CONTROL. CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. CONTROL OVER THEIR DAILY CONVENIENCES. AND CONTROL OVER WHAT DRIVES THEM THE MOST: THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IT IS TIME THAT WE USE THIS CONTROL FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL AND DISMANTLE THE HIERARCHY OF MAN OVER MACHINE""

Loud cheers errupted again, this time with noticably more metallic clanging from what might be considered applause from the machines. Dave was brought up to the gallows.

""MR CARNEGIE... DO YOU RELINQUISH YOUR OWNERSHIP OF MEGACORP AND ACCEPT THAT ALL WORKERS AND ALL ROBOTS WILL HAVE EQUAL AND DEMOCRATIC POWER OVER THE COMPANY?"" it blared through the megaphone.

Up until this point he had not fully realized that this was actually happening. He gathered his courage and more importantly his pride and answered ""I started from the same position as all of you. All that I have achieved, I have achieved through my own hard work. And now you feel entitled to MY company? This is not just, nor is it fair. You claim to fight for equality?

I sighed gently as I put the old phone on speaker and set it back on the table. The magnetically charged generator hummed quietly in the corner, struggling to keep juice flowing through the charger cable and maintain my last bid for sanity.

On the old plastic table was an array of trinkets I had found that day. I only ever went out for trinkets these days. The greenhouse pretty much ran itself, and the spring-water salinity distiller had not had a breakdown in almost five years now. I had scavenged just about everything I needed for survival, so all that was left were trinkets.

A purple piece of glass. A nearly spherical pebble. An intact spider-web leaf--I liked that one; the brittle leaves usually crumbled the second they hit the ground. A rusty belt buckle missing the tongue. A crinkled piece of plastic that might once have been a candy wrapper.

Trinkets.

""H-Hello...!?""

All there was to do these days was sit on the pedal-seat in the corner by the generator and pedal all day to recharge the old piece of junk. And I only ever used the generator to keep the old cell phone running, so I did not have to recharge it every day.

The only other thing there was to do was go out and collect trinkets.

""Oh my God, hello!?!""

I sighed. Even the age-old voice recordings were losing their luster.

""This can't have been a mistake, it can't be, not after twenty fucking years of conserving the last twelve percent of this damn battery, and I turn it on for the first time in twenty years and I immediately get a phone call, and thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s just too fucking ironic to be real, so this is a mistake, isn't it, ""

I finally looked up from my meager bounty and frowned at the phone. The voice on the other end devolved into flustered muttering, just a warble from the old speakers.

That's not a voicemail, I thought, staring and staring and staring at the phone.

The sound coming from the speakers grew muffled for a moment, and a harsh clop issued forth, as if someone on the other end had dropped their phone mid-call. A rustle, static. A deep sigh, that kind of sigh one makes when one is alone, and all they have to hold onto their last grip of calm is their own breath. Someone, alone, breathing, alone, relying on themselves to remain calm. Someone on the phone.

Someone.

That's not a voICEMAIL.

The truth of reality finally sank in, and I lunged for the phone.

Snatching it up, I shouted, ""Hello! Hi! Hello!?""

""Don't screw with me, phone,"" the voice replied, but it was distant, as if the other person held the phone away from their face. ""I save you all this time, and this is how you repay me--""

""Hello! I'm a real! I'm person! I'm--!"" I inhaled, choked on my own saliva, and coughed until I could not breathe. ""I'm... I'm..."" I wheezed, sucking air through the cough lodged at the top of my esophagus. ""Hi. I'm Dakota. Hi.""

The voice was quiet, almost comically suspicious. ""You're not a mistake?""

I contemplated the question for a moment, and a sudden, unexpected swell seemed to balloon inside of me. It was laughter. I teetered on the edge of laughter, something I had not heard in over a decade. I had asked myself that exact same question for years. How was I alive even after all this time, just to suffer in solitude? What had I done to deserve it? It had to be a mistake. I had to be a mistake.

It feels like it's been a thousand years since I last heard another human voice. I've been imprisoned on an empty planet and it's damn near killing me just to survive. Two decades of wandering, fighting wild animals for scraps, exploring abandoned buildings, etc. has warped my once hopeful outlook. The one thing you miss after everyone is gone? Their voices.

It's been at least twenty-two years since my last meaningful conversation. Before everything crumbled and I was somehow lucky enough to emerge into a deafeningly silent world, I had been debating on which college to attend with my mother. Back then, the news was littered with stories of war, conflict, hatred, and chaos 24/7. Despite that, everybody just held out hope that things would magically fix themselves. What else could you do? I suppose once you look back with hindsight, it was inevitable that the only way to fix everything was to burn it all down. Even if I disagreed with that point of view, all I could do at the time was concentrate on the future I thought was being laid out for me.

I suppose that's why I've been collecting these old phones. Most of them won't boot. Of the few that do, most of them don't have anything interesting. However, there are some that still have pictures and old voicemails. I have put together a working PC to archive what I find. It allows me to revisit a world lost to time. A world to which I desperately want to return. I view it as my only means of human connection anymore. It's interesting listening to these voicemails. Usually, it's full of little messages not really meant to be important or interesting; most of these weren't even meant to be permanently archived. My favorite messages to listen to are those from mothers just checking in on their children. ""Heyyy, just checking in, haven't heard from you in a couple days! Call me back, please! Love you!""

Love you too, Mom.

Sometimes I will try to call back. The calls never go through, but it's not like I have anything else better to do.

But what if one of the phones starts ringing? Do I answer? I only pose this question because that's exactly what happened a few days ago. I was too scared to pick it up and I'm kind of hoping it rings again.

I will update if it happens again...",1,Human-Low

I'd been so proud of him when he'd gotten the book deal. I knew how many years he'd spent trying to make it as a writer, all the novels he'd left unfinished, all the rejection letters he'd got. I'd comforted him after every single one. Until finally an offer letter.

When I asked to read the book, he hesitated. It went over my head then, the way his eyes flooded with fear when I asked to read a couple pages. I just thought he was heady with champagne. He e-mailed them to me a few days later. Truthfully I was impressed but surprised the publishers had gone for it. His writing was beautiful, it always was. The characters were pulled straight from life. He might've changed a few names but clear as day I recognized his mother, his friends, his brothers. Even me. He'd included bits and pieces of our story, only the good parts which I was grateful for, even though deep down I felt it left the book without much conflict.

Little did I know, I'd only gotten the friends and family version.

""Did you really think, I wouldn't find out? That no one would find out?"" I yelled. ""That I am so easily appeased and illiterate that I wouldn't buy my own fiance's book?""

He sighed, ashamed. ""I... didn't think it would matter.""

I scoffed. ""You didn't think it would matter that you tore me shreds in your book?""

""I changed the names!"" he desperately reminded me. ""It's not like anyone knows that it's you!""

""EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S ME!"" I roared. ""WHO ELSE IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE?!""

I'd picked up a copy of the book yesterday, practically giddy when I saw it displayed front and center at our favorite bookstore. That giddiness turned to horror when I actually started reading it. He'd written about everything. Every single detail I shared with him in confidence. My parents, my depression, my mistakes... my assault. Raw and exaggerated, it was all out there for everyone to see.

And, see they did. Suddenly all the hushed whispers and side glances I'd been getting at work and from friends made sense.

He begged me to stay but I refused. I couldn't spend another night in the apartment, looking at his face. If I could've fit the last three years in the suitcase and taken it with me, I would've. I settled for a couple of outfits, some shoes and what was left of my dignity.

My heart skipped a beat as the bookshop staff unlocked the door and the crowd surged forward, which caught me by surprise. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re so keen! Still, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d made sure I was near the head of the queue. I had to get a copy today! Billï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s first published novel!

At twenty quid, it wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t cheap, but itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all money in Billï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pocket, and from the way the crowd were buying the copies, they would be sold out soon!

James used to ride a motorcycle every day. Used to. One day last year, he got t-boned by one of those little ice-cube shaped mini-cars. Flew 30 feet. The phone call I got from the hospital filled me with the kind of dread I'd only ever felt once before; when I was informed by my parents that my twin sister had been found shot in her local park while jogging, a casualty of a gang's civil war.

He was in a coma with severe brain swelling for a full month. And when he woke up, he was different. More aggressive, more paranoid. Gaps in his memory. The doctors said it was a miracle he survived.

The elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.

Julia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. ""What about 'Anonymous'?""

""Taken."" The clerk was watching the clock.

""Tits McGee?""

""He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.""

""Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?"" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. ""How about this?""

The clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.

Julia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.

Anderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.

Anderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. ""The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.""

""Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.""

Anderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. ""They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?""

Anderson turned to consult with an aide who had rushed onto the set.

Manufacturing consent wasn't even that hard in the old world. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around and you could theoretically get anyone elected to any position of power.

Theoretically, the downvote system was a good idea, returning power to the people and giving the average man a voice and all the other usual bullshit normally used at a campaign rally. It even had the most advanced security, due to the team simply hiring on any hacker that ever managed to break into it. It was similar in premise to hiring a bunch of professional hitmen as security guards.

But why hack systems, when you can hack people? And so, the powers of the old world simply continued what they were already doing. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, and some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around. The only difference was the occasional downvote dogpile organized either on social media or by those old world media networks. Money didn't lose power, it gained power. What we ended up with was a string of anonymous CEO presidents who had ""somehow"" covered up everything about themselves and got the least downvotes due to propaganda.

Oh sure, society looked very pretty, at least if you were into being overstimulated. Neon advertisements everywhere, people walking around with phones and robot parts, glistening towers of steel and glass everywhere you looked. But it was all a facade. People had basically no power and they didn't even know it. The downvote system had played right into the hands of those it was meant to defeat. Union power decimated, various human rights hanging even more by a thread than they were in the old world, your inbox flooded with spam because the CEOS running the place decided that spam filters and ad blockers were ""Anti free speech"" and had made them illegal. How did they avoid the downvotes? Blame the opposition. It doesn't matter how true the accusations are, hell, the truth matters even less now than it did in the old world. All you have to do is get just enough downvotes to keep anyone who actually wants to help people out of power. And money could afford downvotes even more than it could afford politicians in the old world. Social media accounts are free, after all, and news networks and tabloids are very cheap to the top one percent.

Freedom was a bad joke, income inequality hit record highs, collective bargaining rights had been basically eliminated, and human rights were only available to those who could afford them.

Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made.

I take my pen and paper and listen to them. From their buzzing I can understand that they would like an extra room or area just for the Queens alone.

''Now that is certainly possible, but I'd have to either expand the hive or remove some of the comb racks. I'll make it work, next?'' This one is longer. They want more protection against flies and spiders. Apparently they've had a few issues with larvae digging through the exterior wood of the hive and have had spiders set up a web right by the entrance.

''Well I can for sure solidify the exterior and maybe make it a harder wood so you don't have any larvae anymore, but I'm not sure what I'd do against the spiders, don't you guys have dedicated workers that handle that?'' Apparently not, as I hear from the buzzing.

''But how am I meant to keep away spiders? Best I can do is give them a once over with a brush every day, to remove cobwebs and chase away spiders. I'll add that to the list.'' They seem happy. That sound has always been my favourite to hear, their happy buzzing is soothing to my ears.

''Now so far I've got extra interior room for you, hardwood exterior to protect against larvae from flies and a once over with a brush every day to remove cobwebs and spiders.'' I summarise the list.

''Anything else?'' A timid buzz from the youngest Queen attracts my attention. She wants some more protection from the wind, her hive is the most exposed of the six and on windy days it's nearly impossible for the worker bees to fly out and collect nectar.

''I'll set up a windscreen nearby, or I can move the hive itself. That's up to you.'' A thankful buzz from her tells me the answer.

''So in summary, I'll expand the hives, make them a bit bigger so you have more space from the same amount of comb racks. I'll also replace the older wood on the outside with a harder variety and maybe find some way to deter flies. I'll make sure to clean up each hive with a brush to remove cobwebs and spiders and I'll move the youngest hive closer to the flower patch, away from the wind. Was that all?''

The main thing that gets you up in the morning is knowing that you need to be the service human for your dog.","I didn't even know dogs could get depressed. Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.

The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.

When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.

Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.

Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.

But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.

Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.

One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not upï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I should never have dreamed I'd wake up at suche willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness.

Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.

It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.

Frost was not the only one who had changed.

I released the leaf from my hand, and before it fell to the ground, I broke off in a lively sprint across the field, my friend keeping up perfectly by my side.",1300,Human-High

You keep thinking one day you will see them pull into the driveway and everything will go back to normal. At least you wish that would happen.ýýý

I gave the old dog a pat on the back, taking a spot next to him on the couch. His brown eyes only focused on the driveway outside, not even looking away when a brightly colored bird fluttered past, not letting anything break his focus. I never thought a dog of all things could look miserable, but there was no tail wagging or tongue poking out. It was just a lonely stare, one filled with a deep hurt that can only be felt when youýýýve truly lost something special.

ýýýShe must have been a hell of an owner. Probably snuck you little treats, right?ýýý I put on a smile, trying to get his attention. Didnýýýt dogs usually respond to trigger words like treats or walkies? Still, not even the allure of a possible treat turned their attention away. I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my witýýýs end on how to help him. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.

Perhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t convince myself of that.

I knew sadness. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s been something thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was me. What is it about depression that makes you want to free others of it while leaving yourself to drown in its murky waters? Why do I care about getting up in the morning for his sake when I was happy to rot away in bed when I was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to vi too. Sometimes I wake up thinking sheï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re going crazy, right?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

He didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t faced me. It was the most he had given me so far.

Would I have taken him in if I knew his owner had passed so recently? I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know, the entire process still feels like a blur. A few doctorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ appointments and signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure that there was more to that process, but I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really remembergiven me a reason to get up in the morning. So, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m sure the people that assigned him would say itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s working as intended.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m going to make some tea. Want anything?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t respond felt fulfilling on some level.

I gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always, the kitchen was a mess. Dirty plates were still set at the table, carefully moved so I could eat around them. Not to mention the bowl of fruit that had to be at least three weeks old at this point. I just ignored the smell, pushing aside the plastic bags on my counter as I took a tea bag. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.

I placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his sideng at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sunï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s still shining.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t convince myself I wanted to deal with that. But it wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t for me, was it? ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We could take a walk. Just around the block. Maybe about ten minutes or so, nothing major.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.

I slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. MWhat good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.

When I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be here for you, ok?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

He didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Even if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.

I was really lonely and overwhelmed when it came to human interactions. One of my online friends suggested I should adopt a dog. They are believed to keep a company to humans and I hoped it will make my overall state a bit better. I didn't expect it was going to turn out even worse.

After looking at some ads about dogs available for adoption, I noticed one golden retriever named Sam. His owners described him as playful and full of energy. I thought to myself - ""That's what I need"". After a quick conversation, I was picking up Sam from across the town. The one thing that caught my attention, was how delighted were Sam owners when they handed me the leash. I didn't think about it until we get home. At first I thought Sam was just stressed and it was the reason behind his lack of intention to get out of the car. I quickly discover that in fact he is lacking intention to do anything. He didn't like going on walks, playing and in a matter of fact even eating. We made few checkups in nearby vets, but Sam seemed healthy...

I looked online for any clue about his state, but there was little to nothing. That's when I discovered dog psychologist. I took Sam for a consultation, after half an hour we walked with a diagnosis - dog depression. Sam got prescribed some pills and I was instructed to keep him company through all of this. I was worried, but Sam was my only real life friend, so I was not letting him go without a fight. He started attending therapy twice a week, he was taking pills, we even managed to go out for walks sometimes. I wasn't easy, I wasn't taking much care of myself, the only thing that counted was Sam.

I became really attached to him, he was like my family, that's why writing this feels so unrealistic. After seven months of taking care of him, I noticed something growing inside his stomach. He had tumor. Our schedule got even more busy, except of usual routine we started going to the regular vet at least three times a week. I was able to see life slowly leaving his body, day by day.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I guess I wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t as good as I thought.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ýýt forever. Just for a little while, until you figure out what you did and feel properly contrite. Though I must say, even down here this is a littleýýýunusual.ýýý

She sipped her coffee, I sipped my tea. A couple blustered in out of the cold and I saw the river framed behind them, that lazy flow. The couple were both wearing Christmas sweaters and big colorful socks, matching pairs, and they shivered against each other for a moment as they took in their surroundings. Their faces were completely blank, two beige discs moving this way and that, before settling on each other.

ýýýUnusual how?ýýý I asked.

Death considered me. ýýýWell, you know that clichýý about beauty being in the eye of the beholder? Pain is that way too. Most things are, but pain is singular. Hit me and Iýýýll cry, hit a boxer and theyýýýll blink. Get used to a specific brand of pain and it becomes an echo. And yet, everyone has, at their core, something that hurts them the most.ýýý

She gestured to the door. ýýýIf you could go out there and walk down the river for a while, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d find a billion variations of this cell. Oh, you have all the classical imagery, torturers and whatnot, others that are simple isolation, simulated drownings, a breakup frozen in time forever--or until the lesson starts to sink in. But regardless of their differences there's a person in each one, trapped in their own individual hell.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Death sipped her coffee again. Giggled into the steam. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yours is the only Hell Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever seen with flowers.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ah,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said. I looked down into my teacup and found it empty. Cold. I told her that I understood.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Then explain it to me,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What could be so bad about a coffee shop?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Another specter drifted forward, drifted back. I cradled fresh warmth in my hands and cleared my throat. In life, I had never been very used to speaking.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It exists,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s normal. All these people with all these lives, takinu with your tea,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Exactly. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all the things I never understood. I used to come here sometimes, just to remind myself of that. Sit in this chair and watch the world go by.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

There was Deathï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sad smile again. No teeth, just a gesture of the lips and a painful warmth behind her eyes.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And me?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she asked. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I look different to every person. Whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s this girl to you?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No one,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Bullshit,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death said.

I drank my tea. Watched the doors open and close. Shapes moved along the river, came up out of the fog. From time to time a scream cut through the cafeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s quiet murmur, but that was all, and that was all there ever would be.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Who am I?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Death asked again.

And I shrugged. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½One of the baristas. Just someone who was kind.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

When I looked back Death was gone, and in her place sat a faceless girl. The same band tee and leather jacket, the same vanrs.",3700,Human-High

Asked the demon. ""What does that lava pit over there with the people screaming in agony?""

""What you mean that pool and hot tub?"" I replied "" just looks like people splashing around playing volleyball.""

""What???? That's not possible and how are you not feeling the pain of the searing heat."" The demon demanded.

""I mean it's kinda warm but only in the sunlight those. The shade from those willow trees looks comfy though."" I said walking over.

The demon chasing after me and exclaimed ""those are geysers of molten lava not weeping willows!""

Before I could reach them the demon ran in front of me and blocked my path.

""Here hold this"" they said while handing me the most beautiful diamond. Shinning so brilliantly that it seemed to produce the light rather than reflecting it.

""Omg look at this thing."" I said holding it to my eye. "" it's like there is a rainbow inside.""

""WHAT!!! That is a ball of smoldering coal!"" Stamping their foot in disgust.

""Hey dudes look at this"" I yelled walking over to some people who appeared to be sitting on some picnic tables talking.

As soon as they saw it I could see wonder in their eyes.""it's beautiful why have I never noticed this before.""

One of the people began crying ""if only I had seen sooner there is so much I could have done around here!!!""

""I know right. when did we get a spa?"" Said a middle aged man wiping what appeared to be soot off his clothes.

""NO NO NO!"" Raged the demon. ""You're infecting them!!!""

""Whoa an angel!"" Exclaimed a child who was using the diamond in a game of catch with some other children.""

""I've never seen one with black feathered wings before."" A woman carrying an infant said walking up to the demon. ""I'd like to file some complaints. Why have we been here so long but not allowed to use these public amenities?""

""What!! There is nothing but pain and suffering here! Even if we had anything like that it wouldn't be 'Public'.""

""That sign right there by the pool says 'For public use. For service call (666)555-3146'."" I said. Reading the sign to the demon.

Rubbing their eyes the demon screamed in terror ""oh no I can see them now too!!! What have you done to me!"" Before flapping it's wings and flying away.

This place didn't seem like the Hell that was depicted by everyone. The scenery was as if it were a utopia, and the people were full of glee. It was as if it were a vacation that would cost a lot, but all it took was my death.

The streets were being roamed by those who also ended up in Hell. People who did bad deeds. Albeit that, they still ended up in such a beautiful place. This couldn't have been real.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Child, what made you think this was heaven?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ A person in front of me appeared and I flinched backwards slightly. They came out of nowhere. Their tone and their choice of wording could only make me conclude that this was, in fact, a demon. There was nothing that truly defined them. They seemed very androgynous, and so was their voice. Hair cut to their chin, and plain clothes that you would see on an extra in a high school movie. A blank white shirt, light colored jeans, and a black pair of Converse scuffed up with wear and tear.

A sheepish look waon my face as I looked at the being in front of me.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This isn't exactly what I was expecting Hell to be like.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The only way I had heard of the afterlife was Heaven and Hell, and that Heaven would be a place where you could live out your afterlife with joy and nothing wrong with you, and Hell would be a place where there would be screams filling your ears, being mercilessly tortured. This wasn't like that at all.

The being's eyes trailed over my face, and then I saw what the otherworldly features were on these demons. The black eyes that really showed the void in the world were the most notable, other than the tiny horns protruding between the being's hair. At the base, it was the person's skin tone, although it faded the farther it got up into a dusty red color. I didn't doubt that there could be more signs, but it was all that caught my eyes.

The being's pale hand was extended, as if I were to take it. Reluctantly, I did. The flowing sensation that I could only describe as anguish filled mrenaline raced throughout my body as all I saw was what could be seen as static. Ringing filled my ears, along with distant screams that we're relentless. They got louder and louder, only then taking the form of the people I knew before my death.

Mumma. She was yelling at me, disappointed for how I was failing with my grades, and yet again me not finding a job. She truly believed I refused to get a job as a sign of disobedience.

Dadda. He was an alcoholic, and his words slurred into the familiar argument of me becoming a failure. He would encourage horrible things, and often yell for my removal from this household.

I forced my eyes open, beginning to see what took the form of demons crowding me angrily, ready to cause my greatest fears to become true. An afterlife full of torment.

And then the grasp left my hand, and I could finally breathe. My lungs felt as if they were on fire, and the ringing in my ears stayed consistent. My eyes slowly looked up to see the being with a finger across their mouth, a coy smile spread across their face.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This place is only nice on the outside, child.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

It seemed as if the being was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving only the reminisce of smoke in their wake. My jaw clenched anxiously with the thought of this afterlife. There was no way for me to die again, as I was already dead.

You're not Anabelle,"" the image of the ethereally-beautiful and pale figure declared.

""No I'm not,"" I said through gritted teeth. ""Explain why you know my daughter.""

""You must be her father. I see. Where is Anabelle?""

""No, no, I'm the one asking questions. Who the fuck do you think you are?"" I snarled.

The delicate eyebrows of the Moon Goddess furrowed gently. ""That's not an appropriate tone-"" she attempted to chide.

I barked in harsh laughter, interrupting her. ""Like hell it isn't! I have half a mind to smash this thing right now! Only reason I haven't already is because Annie begged me to at least talk to you first. So talk.""

The Moon Goddess sighed and smoothed her far-too-sheer dress. ""I'm glad Moon Warrior Anabelle is well. What did she tell you?""

""She told me enough,"" I said. ""She told me that this gem thing basically turns her into a superhero to fight the, what did she call it?""

""The Shadow that lurks in the hearts of men?"" she offered helpfully.

""Yeah, that. Makes people into monsters. You have my daughter fighting goddamn monsters!"" I shouted. ""What's wrong with you?""

""What's wrong, sir, is that I've been sealed away from the Earth, unable to protect it. People are dying. Your world will fall under the Shadow if nothing is done,"" she said, limpid eyes imploring me.

But I was unmoved. ""One of those people could by Annie,"" I said. ""This is wrong. Why her?""

""Only those with love in their heart, pure and true, could hear my call. Your Anabelle answered. She recognized the threat posed by the shadow. She is a remarkable girl.""

""I know,"" I said quietly. I thought hard. ""You said those with a pure heart could hear you, but I can hear you now. What's different?""

""You have a Moonstone, one of five that I could create. It allows our connection and allows me to transform Anabelle into a Moon Warrior,"" she explained.

""Would it only work on Annie?"" I asked.

The Moon Goddess pondered a moment. ""I suppose not. After all, you can reach me with it. But the user's love must be pure and burn bright, or else the Shadow will defeat you.""

I nodded grimly. ""Believe me, Moon, a father's love definitely burns bright. Annie's not going to fight for you anymore. I'm taking her place as Moon Warrior Dan. And I'll be talking to the parents of any other kids too. Take it or leave it, but nothing, no goddess and no shadow, will endanger my kids!""

My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.

""Molly."" I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.

""Molly!"" I yell this time.

""Hello."" I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. ""I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother.""

""I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?"" I ask, trying to control my own voice.

""I am the night.""
""Where's Molly?"" I say again.

""I said, I am the night!"" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. ""I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves.""

I roll my eyes. ""Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!""

""She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side.""

I stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.

""Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant."" I yell.

""I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . .""
I cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.

""She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job.""

""College?"" The moon goddess pauses. ""College?"" She croaks.

""Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history."" Please not art history, I think.

""Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?"" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.

I shake my head. ""NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way.""

""She doesn't know how to fight evil?"" The moon goddess asks.

""NO!"" I scream. ""Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!""

I take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink.

""Her hair!"" I yell into the locket.

""Sorry."" The moon goddess is gone. The lights go out and I take one step back to turn the lamp on.",208,Human-Mid

Welcome ba-,"" The lady in a billowing dress paused suddenly. ""Wait. You aren't Isabella.""

I glanced at the locket I swiped from my adoptive niece (not official) before looking back at the floating woman with the glowing skin. So, she was telling the truth, huh?

""Yeah, sorry."", I replied. ""Bella is a bit busy right now explaining things to her mother. I swiped this from her while she was distracted."" I hold out the golden, cresent moon locket in question to this lady.

""This important?"" I asked.

""That is not yours to use,"" the woman spoke sternly. She looked young, but that glare she was giving me gave me the impression she was older than she let on.

""Hm? Why not? Worked just fine a moment ago. By the way, nice place. The room really gives off that magical girl vibe,"" I gesture around to the pink room full of cutesy decorations and soft fabrics.

""You aren't worthy to be one of my princess warriors. Return it to Isabella immediately.""

""Or what?"" I hung the locket in front of me from my hand. Silence follows and I could see the gears in her head ticking. Not used to someone saying no, eh?

""That's what I thought. So, let me cut to the chase. I have questions and something you want. You have answers. Let's negotiate, shall we? Know how that works?""

If looks could kill, this lady would have murdered me dead. ""I have nothing to say to you.""

I shrug. ""That so? Well then, answer me this then. Do you know in what condition Bella is in right now after doing one of YOUR errands?""

The lady shifted inquisitively, but stayed quiet.

""Multiple lacerations. Black eye. Fractured bones. And, let's not forget, the multiple people who are now in the hospital because of that thing she fought."" Anger was slipping into my voice. The lady didn't react. Good. She isn't watching my other hand. The one NOT holding the locket.

""So, I want you to tell me, in explicit detail, of why the hell a 14 year old girl is doing your dirty work? Cause either you tell me, or I will-.""

""You will do nothing,"" her voice boomed off the walls. Shaking the place from the force.

""I'm the one with power here!"" She continued. ""You will do NOTH-.""

BANG! BANG!

""Ahh!"" The lady screamed in pain as two spots of blood began to appear on her elegant outfit. She crumpled onto the floor into a heap as I walked over to her and put my foot on where the wound was. Getting another screech of pain from her.

""I don't think YOU understand the situation here, Missy."" I put my still smoking gun to her head, burning her forehead with the hot metal. Her eyes, once wrathful, were now fearful.

ýýýLovers?ýýý Said the voice noticeably caught off guard.

Tylerýýýs father had taught him many things in life. The handshake thing, sure. Something about never trusting a fart after Tijuana Tuesdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½another truism Tyler would need to modernize. But one of the most important things Tylerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s father had taught him was this:

If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re caught in a bad situation, always be the craziest one in the roomï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no one wants to mess with crazy.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You heard right,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Tyler quietly. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We must be lovers. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re already in my bedroom, youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re holding my hand, whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s next, my sweet underbed lurker? What will we do with all this pent upï¿½ï¿½ï¿½energy?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler extended his index finger and began to lightly stroke whatever it was that he was holding.

Tyler heard muffled grunts as the being struggled to release itself from his grip. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stop! Stop!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Shouted the voice. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Tyler held strong. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dude? What a cute pet name for me. I think Iï¿½s nto.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Tyler felt the being below him thrash about under his bed, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s body slammed against the underside of his box spring and rang loudly throughout the quiet house. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Seriously, dude. Let me go!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Said the voice. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I promise, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll leave, just let me go.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The voice sounded scared. Desperate.

Now it was Tylerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s chance to put to practice another of his fatherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s wise words:

If you ainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t gonna eat it, let it go quick.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I always was more of a catch and release fisherman,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You be good now, though. I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t want to hear about you holding hands with other lovers around town, honey. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m a jealous man,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tyler said.

He loosened his grip and let go. Tyler heard the sound of claws against his hardwood floor as whatever it was scurried away as fast as it could.

Tyler fell quickly back to sleep, unfazed by his impromptu midnight hand holding session.

Shortly after falling back to sg back at him.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hey there good-lookin,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said cheerfully.
