    "story": "My mother jerks open the dark green filing cabinet, which teeth-rattles; from its wide-open mouth she pulls out two white envelopes, our names written carefully in pencil. I won\u2019t ask my brother about his letter; he will never ask about mine. He slips the envelope into a deep tan briefcase and drives to his brand-new flat. I have nowhere to go but back.\n\nWe\u2019re eating sticky donuts as we head out to the swamps for a boat ride. It\u2019s his retirement holiday after all, just the two of us.\n\nMy father says there are three things I should know about mangroves:\n\nMangroves act as buffers against storms. He makes a joke about how he should have planted them in the back garden for when my mother had \u2018one of her days.\u2019\n\nMangroves have a great capacity to absorb carbon. He draws quickly on his cigarette even if she\u2019s not there to see him.\n\nOnce mangroves are gone, they can\u2019t simply be replaced. Neither of us moves.\n\nWe stop for lunch; I think I see an alligator on a nearby bank.\n\nMy father says there are three things I should know about alligators:\n\nSome alligators eat their young. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, that sandwich was more than enough.\u2019 And wipes crumbs from my cheeks, laughing widely.\n\nMale alligators do not like to share their space with anyone or anything. I remember summer holidays; him striding ahead, binoculars in hand; my mother fit to bursting.\n\nNot only do alligators run, they also climb. He breathes with difficulty; pats my knee, looks heavenwards.\n\nBack at the motel he drinks too much whisky even though he\u2019s not supposed to.\n\nMy father says there are three things I should know about love.\n\nYou can love someone but still have to let them go. He looks awkward until another drink arrives. I wonder if he\u2019s talking about us.\n\nLove is not the cure for everything.  The diagnosis comes as a shock. We spend a hot summer bumping against hospital glass like drunken flies.\n\nLove IS the cure for everything. He kisses me on the forehead then goes wheezing up the stairs to bed.\n\nMy father writes three things in his letter to me.\n\nThree things I already know.",
