    "story": "Leo is transfixed by the perfectly spherical, white globe. He squeals with delight as she holds it to her lips and blows away the tiny cloud with each puff of air:\n\n\u201cOne o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock, three, four, five\u2026 Dinner time!\u201d\n\nThey tumble in the overgrown grass, amongst the seed heads which wait like little ticking time-bombs. Bang \u2013 she is pregnant. Boom \u2013 Gary leaves her, muttering about not being able to turn back the clock. Her life detonates. Now she must care for her son, who only sees his dad on alternate weekends, and go to work, and cook, and clean, and make time for endless chores. Every time she looks at a clock she thinks it must be lying about how much time has passed, or how little.\n\nThis weekend it is her turn to have Leo, who woke at dawn and refused to accept it wasn\u2019t morning. He plays, and she sits on the step with another coffee. She had expected sleepless nights but assumed that they would end \u2013 perhaps nine or ten months of disruption \u2013 then, by the time her maternity leave ended, Leo would be sleeping through. Instead, at eighteen months old, Leo has not given her a single night of unbroken sleep and she wakes at unearthly hours even when he is not there. She is living out of time, as though permanently jet-lagged. She thinks of her bed and of how soon she can get Leo down for a nap and then talks herself out of that dream; she must cut the lawn or it will grow even more unmanageable \u2013 already it is choked with dandelions and countless other weeds. Mowing was Gary\u2019s job.\n\nLeo starts to wail. He is opening and closing his fists in bewilderment and it takes a while to solve the problem \u2013 he has dropped the dandelion he picked for her. After much consideration he finds a substitute and proudly hands it over.\n\n\u201cOne o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock\u2026\u201d\n\nTogether they travel through the markers of the day, past breakfast, snack, lunch and dinner, the remaining seeds clinging on obstinately. Finally, she brings her hand up, like a magician, and when it falls the stalk is empty.\n\n\u201cTen o\u2019clock \u2013 bedtime.\u201d\n\nShe carries Leo upstairs before he has time to protest. Eventually, his breathing slows and his hand, sticky with sap, releases her own.\n\nBack outside the air has grown warmer and she really should cut the grass while it is dry, but instead she lies down in it and closes her eyes. She is a child again, one for whom time has no authority. The drone of a mower starts up a few gardens away and close to her ear there is the answering buzz of a bee. She imagines Leo waking up to find the clocks have lost their faces. And for what? Because someone, a long time ago, decided that these beautiful plants were weeds? She sits up, chooses a clock and blows. It is her time now.",

    "authentic_score": "5",
    "authentic_explanation": "The narrative captures the genuine struggles, thoughts, and emotions of a single mother with resonant themes of time, responsibility, and fleeting moments. Leo's fascination with the 'globe', which serves as an imaginative clock, provides an authentic touch of childhood innocence and curiosity. The mother's own connection to this 'clock' mirrors the stretching and constriction of time in her life.",
    
    "emotion_provoking_score": "4",
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The constant reference to the passage of time paired with the pivotal moments in the mother's life brings forth a melange of emotions. From the thrill of playing with Leo, to the abruptness of life changes, to the exhaustion from sleepless nights, readers are pulled into the whirlwind of her emotional landscape. The use of 'time-bombs' as a metaphor adds an additional layer of intensity.",
    
    "empathy_score": "5",
    "empathy_explanation": "The visceral portrayal of the mother's fatigue and her unending list of responsibilities evokes a deep sense of empathy. Readers can feel her weariness, her moments of joy with Leo, and her longing for simpler times. The vivid imagery and situational contexts make her challenges relatable and palpable.",
    
    "engagement_score": "4",
    "engagement_explanation": "From the delightful play with Leo to the contemplative moments of solitude, the story manages to hold the reader's attention throughout. While there's no dramatic climax, the gentle ebb and flow of emotions coupled with the thematic focus on time ensures steady engagement.",
    
    "narrative_complexity_score": "4",
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "While the story predominantly orbits around a central theme of time, its layers are unpacked through a tapestry of interconnected motifs - the clocks, the dandelion, motherhood, and the idea of 'weeds' in our life. The cyclical nature of time is effectively juxtaposed with the linear progression of life's challenges."
