    "story": "It\u2019s a yellow Friday and I\u2019m about to finish when I see a man in the closest aisle, prodding different packets of biscuits. His mask is the right colour and his boots have elements of December in them. He picks Bourbons and comes straight to my till. I slap on my customer grin.\n\n\u2018Your smile is orange,\u2019 he says. I stare at the words hanging between us.\n\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he says.\n\nI shake my head, hold up an onion. Wobble, \u2018What day is this?\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s easy,\u2019 he says. \u2018August.\u2019\n\n*\n\nColours have a smell; days are feelings, numbers taste. My days shift between shades of red to blue to yellow, to turquoise and back and everything in between. The hours pass in months and sounds and textures.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know anything else about me. These things make my hours processing customers and their shopping an overwhelming kaleidoscope that wears me out and fascinates me, in equal measure. And ensures everyone avoids me during break.\n\nBeep: a bag of oranges that smells of Tuesdays and feels like 12. Beep: a tin of soup that is a mountain side in Spring. \u00a314.93 pence please, which is a Wednesday in July, and smells of beetroot, which is also a cave.\n\nThe beeps themselves are musical, and the customers\u2019 masks don\u2019t always go with their colour. A woman in green who should be wearing a blue mask tries to talk to me so I beep faster. Like my colleagues, she\u2019ll soon realise. I\u2019m fast, and to all of them that\u2019s my best asset.\n\n*\n\nHe watches me as he asks with a smile that\u2019s braver than mine, \u2018What colour is today?\u2019\n\nI\u2019m about to answer when I realise that it\u2019s not important. It\u2019s the fact he asked the question.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s joy,\u2019 I whisper, and as I scan his Bourbons they feel like a beach and I can smell the sun.\n\nAs he puts them in a bag he says softly, \u2018It\u2019s yellow, isn\u2019t it? Like a hymn.\u2019\n\nI nod. I only know we\u2019ve stopped moving when the woman behind him \u2013 purple, all the way, and a bit like anchovies \u2013 does this on-purpose coughing and tuts loudly. Like the sound of an aeroplane landing.\n\nOur hands touch as we both reach for a tin of mushrooms.\n\n\u2018Such a lonely food,\u2019 I can\u2019t help saying.\n\n\u2018I know exactly what you mean,\u2019 he says. \u2018Beige. And cold, like Autumn mud.\u2019\n\nI realise our hands are still touching. Anchovy Woman sounds as if she\u2019s going to burst. And I\u2019m feeling fizzing orange and warm sandstone, safe and solid, as sparks ping back and forth between us. And I know, as surely as I\u2019ve ever known anything, that this man is a safe, seaworthy boat.\n\nI finish scanning his food, he pays, I get up.\n\nBy now it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s Something Happening and all is hush. My colleagues gawp and their faces are gone off cheese and slate tiles. My boat-man and I head to the sea, that is outside.",
