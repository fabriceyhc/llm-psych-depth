    "story": "The boy on his bike is a shark. Each clump of grass? Seaweed. Each broken crash of cholla? A jellyfish. The ground is water—that’s what you tell yourself—not hard-packed desert dirt.\n\nYou throw yourself into the waves and float, waiting to feel lighter, waiting for the boy to pass. But he doesn’t. He rolls up next to you and stops, hovering there with his sharp fin, scenting for blood.\n\nYou’re here to feel the salt spray on your face, taste the tang of summer on your lips, sense the sun shimmering on water. You’re here to listen, and he’s ruining it.\n\nDoesn’t he know that each inch of this ocean is a cure? That time is held in each grain of sand? That if you get quiet enough, the seashells will whisper your sister’s secrets to you?\n\nThey might, but not with him here.\n\nThe cool of his shadow falls across your face. His breath is root beer soda and barbecue sauce.\n\nYou play at being invisible until he touches you, until his words bubble to the surface.\n\n‘Not dead,’ he says and laughs.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, you see his bike tire as a whale’s eye. See his mouth, a pufferfish. See that he’s not going to leave. So you leave first.\n\nEach footstep sucks the wet sand and the ocean slowly recedes behind you, out of your memory. The wheels of the boy’s bike follow, spokes flickering, tires spinning up droplets of dust.\n\nFor one last glimpse, it’s sunlight on water—every chance at being washed clean—then it’s gone. And it’s just the hard desert dirt all around you, miles and miles of dry despair.",

    "authentic_score": 4.0,
    "authentic_explanation": "The imagery is profound, making the desert feel like an ocean. This, in essence, creates a beautifully authentic setting for the protagonist's grief, reimagined as a sea. However, while the setting feels honest, the boy's sudden interjection feels slightly forced and lessens the overall authenticity.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 5.0,
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The juxtaposition of desert and ocean, and the symbolism of grief as a vast, ever-changing body of water is deeply poignant. The writing paints a vivid emotional landscape that allows the reader to resonate with the protagonist’s longing and despair.",
    "empathy_score": 4.0,
    "empathy_explanation": "The central theme of grief and the desire to connect with a lost loved one are universally relatable. Readers can easily empathize with the protagonist's need for solace and the frustration when it's interrupted. Yet, the abruptness of the boy's entrance does somewhat deter from fully experiencing the depth of the protagonist’s emotions.",
    "engagement_score": 4.0,
    "engagement_explanation": "The text keeps the reader's attention through vivid imagery and the transformation of an ordinary desert landscape into a poignant seascape. The narrative takes a twist with the boy's unexpected intrusion, leading readers to question his role and the protagonist’s reaction.",
    "narrative_complexity_score": 4.0,
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The blending of reality and imagination, the vast emotional sea set in a desert, and the interjection of another character creates layers of narrative complexity. While it remains mostly accessible, some readers might find themselves disoriented by the sudden shifts."
