    "story": "Eliza watched the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms fall gracefully to the ground, each descent a silent testament to the fleeting nature of life. She was here, in their shared garden, a place once brimming with laughter and shared dreams, now echoing only with the heavy weight of absence. \n\nJames had always said that the garden was a mirror of their souls; where every flower bloomed and withered in tandem with their joys and sorrows. Eliza remembered the day he'd planted the cherry blossom tree, his hands covered in dirt, eyes sparkling with mischief. 'For our fiftieth,' he had said, envisioning a future they would never see.\n\nIt wasn't just the emptiness of the bed beside her, the untouched shoes, or the vacant chair. It was the small, invisible threads of shared experiences that tethered her heart to a ghost of memories. Each memory was like a short film, vivid and pulsating with life; their first date, their fights, the whispered promises under a canopy of stars.\n\nShe felt a mix of pain and love so profound it physically ached. There were moments she felt so submerged in grief, she believed she would never resurface. And yet, there were instants, fleeting as the cherry blossom's fall, where the memories brought warmth, a gentle caress of the past.\n\nEliza\u2019s neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, often said that time healed all wounds. But for Eliza, time wasn't a healer; it was a revealer. It revealed the depths of love she had for James and the immense void his absence had created. It was a juxtaposition of the happiest memories and the cruel reality.\n\nIn her solitude, she often spoke to James. Conversations that began in sorrow often ended in laughter. She would recount stories of their youth, asking for advice on mundane things, and sometimes, just whispering, 'I miss you.' Those moments were cathartic. A connection to a love that defied the constraints of life and death.\n\nTheir grandson, Ben, with his wide-eyed innocence, once asked her, 'Do you still love grandpa, even if he\u2019s gone?' Eliza had knelt down, looked into those earnest eyes and replied, 'Love isn't about presence, darling. It\u2019s about feeling. And I feel your grandpa every day, in every breeze, every scent, every petal that falls.'\n\nAs the sun set, casting an orange-pink hue, Eliza sat by the cherry blossom tree, a tear rolling down her cheek. She whispered a silent prayer, a thank you for the time she had with James, and a plea for strength in his absence. With a deep sigh, she picked up a fallen blossom, holding it delicately, understanding deeply the transient nature of life and love. Yet, also knowing that true love, like memories, had a way of being eternal.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story**:\n------------------\nEliza watched the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms fall gracefully to the ground, each descent a silent testament to the fleeting nature of life.
