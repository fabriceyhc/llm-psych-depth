    "story": "Sarah, a mother in her late forties, stood outside her 17-year-old son Alex's room. The door, covered in posters of obscure bands and political slogans, was ajar. Soft music and intermittent typing were the only sounds permeating through.\n\nShe took a deep breath, remembering the days when she used to cradle him to sleep. How had time slipped so quickly, turning that cooing baby into this passionate, opinionated teenager? She recalled the countless nights they spent talking about everything and nothing. But lately, their conversations felt like navigating a minefield. They were short, curt, and invariably ended in silences or, worse, slamming doors.\n\nSarah gently knocked, breaking the rhythm of Alex's typing. \"Mind if I come in?\" she asked hesitantly.\n\nAlex looked up, surprised, \"Sure, Mom.\"\n\nSarah made her way inside, taking in the room she had been in countless times but somehow felt foreign now. She saw pictures of Alex's friends, his girlfriend Lisa, and amidst all the chaos, a small, slightly faded photograph of a younger Sarah holding baby Alex.\n\nShe pointed to the photo, \"Remember this day?\"\n\nAlex chuckled, \"Not really, I was a baby. But you've told me about it.\"\n\nSarah smiled, \u201cThat day, at the park, you cried until I got you that ice cream cone. But then you were too scared to eat it because of the bees. And somehow, all you wanted was for me to hold you.\u201d She paused, trying to control the emotion in her voice. \u201cI guess, sometimes, amidst all this growth, I miss my little boy.\u201d\n\nAlex sighed, shifting uncomfortably. \"Mom, things change. I'm growing up.\"\n\nSarah nodded, \u201cI know. And it terrifies me. The world out there isn\u2019t always kind. I want to protect you, but I also need to trust you. Trust that I raised you right.\u201d\n\nThey sat in silence, the weight of unsaid feelings pressing down. It was Alex who finally broke it, \"I get it, Mom. But you have to understand. I have my life, my friends, my relationship with Lisa. I need you to trust that I can handle it. That I can handle my emotions, my decisions.\"\n\nSarah held back tears, \"I do trust you, Alex. I just... I just miss us. Our relationship. We used to talk, laugh, share. Now, I feel like I'm losing you.\"\n\nAlex looked deep into his mother's eyes, seeing the fear, love, and longing. \"You're not losing me, Mom. Our relationship is just evolving, just like I am. We'll find our way.\"\n\nSarah smiled, wiping away a tear, \"Promise?\"\n\nAlex nodded, \"Promise.\"\n\nThe room, once filled with tension, now brimmed with hope. As mother and son sat side by side, the underlying threads of affection and understanding bound them tighter than ever.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story**:\n------------------\nSarah, a mother in her late forties, stood outside her 17-year-old son Alex's room.
