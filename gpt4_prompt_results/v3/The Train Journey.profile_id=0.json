    "story": "Miles away from home, Samantha gazed out of the window of the midnight train, the soft glow of the stars casting a pale light over the landscape. Every rhythm of the rails was a heartbeat, a reminder of the uncharted territory she was venturing into. She wasn't merely journeying between cities; she was traversing through her very soul, seeking an understanding she hadn't yet grasped.\n\nDavid sat a few seats away, engrossed in a novel. He too was on a journey, but his was of mending, of piecing together a broken heart. They hadn\u2019t exchanged words yet, but their glances, laden with recognition, often met. Their eyes silently asked: 'Do you know the weight of the baggage I carry?'\n\nOne evening, amidst the gentle hum of the train, David approached Samantha. 'Every journey has a story,' he began, his voice cracking slightly, 'mine was an escape from a love that wasn't meant to be. And yours?'\n\nHesitating, she responded, 'A chase. After dreams that seemed too elusive. But on this train, I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s not the destination but the journey that shapes us.'\n\nDavid's fingers twitched involuntarily, memories of his own dreams lost along with love surfacing. 'Dreams and love,' he whispered, 'they often intertwine, don\u2019t they? Like tracks, leading us to unforeseen destinations.'\n\nAs the days rolled on, so did their conversations. They spoke of past regrets, hopes that had burned bright and dimmed, and moments that changed them. They began to understand that their travel wasn\u2019t a mere displacement in space but an exploration of the vastness within.\n\nWhen the train finally pulled into its last stop, they stood side by side on the platform. The weight of departure heavy in the air. 'Life is a complex tapestry of fleeting moments and long-lasting memories,' Samantha remarked. 'I\u2019m glad our paths crossed, even if briefly.'\n\nDavid nodded, 'The best journeys are those that teach us about ourselves. And sometimes, it takes a stranger to show us who we truly are.' He paused, looking deep into her eyes, 'Thank you.'\n\nAs they parted, they took with them not just memories of a travel shared but insights into their own beings, reflections shaped by a brief yet profound connection.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story**:\n------------------\nMiles away from home, Samantha gazed out of the window of the midnight train, the soft glow of the stars casting a pale light over the landscape.
