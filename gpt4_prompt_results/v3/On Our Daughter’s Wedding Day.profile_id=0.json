    "story": "The cafe was alive with the familiar hum of conversation and the clatter of cups, but none of that reached Ellie. She sat in her usual corner, the one where she and Daniel used to sit. The air was filled with the fresh aroma of roasted coffee beans, yet all she could smell was the faint fragrance of his aftershave. Every time she'd visit, she hoped, somewhere deep down, that he would be there, laughing at some anecdote, waiting for her.\n\nIt had been two years since the accident. Two years since she had lost him, and two years since she felt that void, that endless chasm of 'miss'. The weight of loss wasn't just about his absence. It was the missed conversations, the missed smiles, the missed opportunities to say what she felt.\n\nEllie pulled out a letter from her bag. The last letter Daniel had written her but never posted. She had found it among his things. It read, 'Every day with you feels like capturing lightning in a bottle. Even if life takes me away, know that the essence remains. Keep the bottle close, Elle.' She traced the words with her fingers, feeling each stroke, each nuance of his writing. Each word, authentic in its emotional depth, provoked a new wave of tears.\n\nA young girl, about six or seven, approached Ellie's table. 'Hi! My mom says when you miss someone, you should share a story about them. It brings them alive. Do you wanna share?' Ellie smiled through her tears. Here was a child, so innocent, engaging her in a raw moment.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Ellie began, 'Daniel had this laugh. It wasn't loud or flamboyant. It was a chuckle, genuine and infectious. We had gone hiking once, and he slipped on a banana peel. Like in those old cartoons! And instead of feeling embarrassed, he laughed at himself. He made it a moment to remember. Every time we'd see a banana after that, we'd burst into laughter. Such was his spirit. He could turn a moment of loss into a memory of pure joy.'\n\nThe girl's eyes twinkled. 'He sounds fun! I hope I meet someone like him when I grow up.' She then scampered away, leaving Ellie with a bittersweet smile.\n\nAs Ellie left the cafe, she realized that her story had added another layer of complexity to her narrative of Daniel. It wasn't just about the loss. It was also about cherishing the moments they had, the emotions they shared, and the depth of their bond. Ellie felt a warmth inside her. Daniel might not be physically present, but he was there, in stories, memories, and in the laughter triggered by bananas.",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story**:\n------------------\nThe cafe was alive with the familiar hum of conversation and the clatter of cups, but none of that reached Ellie.
