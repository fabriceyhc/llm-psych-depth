    "authentic_explanation": "The story captures the emotions and cultural nuances of a widow in Indian society with precision. The protagonist's sentiments towards traditions, her sense of isolation, and the raw longing for her deceased husband feel deeply real and human. However, since the cultural practices described might not be universally understood, it may not resonate as authentic to all readers.",
    "authentic_score": 4,
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The narrative exceptionally depicts a wide range of emotions. The repeated phrase \"I miss you\" accompanied by varying reasons adds an undulating rhythm of grief, evoking deep emotional reactions. The story doesn't just tell the reader how the protagonist feels; it effectively shows the depth of her pain through poignant imagery.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": 5,
    "empathy_explanation": "The protagonist's plight, her feelings of exclusion during her own daughter's wedding, and the description of her challenges as a widow in a traditional society lead the reader to deep introspection. It is hard not to empathize with the character, and her act of resistance at the end sparks a moment of pride and connection.",
    "empathy_score": 5,
    "engagement_explanation": "The story's emotional undertones keep the reader engaged throughout. Each line uncovers a new layer of the protagonist's feelings. However, the singular setting and event, while intimate, may not maintain the same level of engagement for all readers.",
    "engagement_score": 4,
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The protagonist's character is deeply explored, revealing the internal conflict she faces between conforming to societal expectations and her desire to be present for her daughter. However, the story does not delve into the relationships between other characters, and the narrative mainly focuses on a single event. The complexities of the larger narrative and other characters' personalities are not deeply examined.",
