It was an unequal marriage after all \u2013 she had the money and position, while he only had age and good looks on his side. She always imagined that if anyone was going to walk away, it would be her.\n\n\u2018Not often,\u2019 he said, \u2018but every now and again.\u2019\n\nShe struggled for a moment, her brain in a whirr, the questions whispering and shouting in her mind. \u2018When?\u2019 she asked, trying to sound as if it didn\u2019t really matter.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s not do this,\u2019 he said, but though he lifted his newspaper, he didn\u2019t start to read it.\n\n\u2018That time Harry invited us to his villa in Menorca and you couldn\u2019t take time off.

You haven\u2019t left me \u2013 that must mean something.\u2019\n\nHe stood for a moment, his fist grasped around the door handle, then his grip loosened, and he came back to the chair opposite Caroline\u2019s sofa.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s not do this,\u2019 he said turning to the crossword and lifting a pen.\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Caroline agreed, \u2018you\u2019re right, let\u2019s not.\u2019",

Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nLet's Not\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\n\u2018There have been times,\u2019 she stopped reading the magazine article, \u2018when I\u2019ve thought about it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 he said, and she\u2019s glad he understands. \u2018Me too.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 came out of her mouth without warning \u2013 she hadn\u2019t expected this response.
