    "story": "At five, he tumbled into the box. It smelled of possibility. The floor was thick with things to dress up in, people to become. He lifted a fireman\u2019s helmet, pressed a doctor\u2019s stethoscope to his chest. There was so much choice. In the corner, he spied a cowboy hat with a broad, curled brim. The fit wasn\u2019t perfect, but he liked the feel of it on his head. Rummaging, he found a waistcoat, a neckerchief and a sheriff\u2019s badge. He clambered out and saw in the mirror: a law enforcer, handsome and brave. If this didn\u2019t get him noticed, nothing would. He spun a pistol into his holster and swaggered off to save the day.\n\nAt seventeen, he slumped against the box but refused to get in. He reached over the side and fetched things out one by one. The choices were mostly unappealing \u2013 bold colours, branded shirts, clean lines. He wanted something that would make a statement, quietly. He raked his fringe across his face, pushed an earring into his left lobe, felt its tiny crucifix swing. He squeezed into a pair of tight jeans, buckled a pair of boots and slid on a dark coat that stretched to his ankles. The figure in the mirror was troublesome and he liked that. Sparking a freshly rolled cigarette, he sloped off to make some kind of stand.\n\nAt thirty, he woke early, anxiety pricking his insides. He got into the box and put on the morning suit that was laid out on the floor. The tails felt foreign, the pressed trousers stiff. He wondered how this had come to be the costume of commitment. Would it help him to be the right man? Buttonhole, cravat, a pocket square to match. He fastened his cufflinks and checked his reflection. Assured that he looked the part, he strode off to have and to hold.\n\nAt fifty-five, he climbed wearily into the box. It smelled of profit and loss. An array of suits hung around its cracked walls \u2013 charcoals, greys, blues \u2013 all too big, none stitched with him in mind. Reflecting on the shape in the mirror, he marvelled at how he had come this far and fooled so many. Knotting his tie and smoothing the whisps of his hair, he shuffled off to do someone else\u2019s business.\n\nAt seventy, he lowered himself into the box. It was empty, and smelled of opportunities missed. He unbuttoned his suit jacket and let it slide away. He twisted the gold band from his left hand and watched it drop. He unbuckled his boots, stubbed out his cigarette, surrendered his pistol and his badge. He shed all his clothing, all the accoutrements, every mask he\u2019d ever worn, one after another. Naked, he stepped out to examine himself in the mirror, and saw there was no one there.",

Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nBox\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nAt five, he tumbled into the box.
