    "story": "My daughter was on all fours in the garden last night, howling at the moon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a phase,\u201d her father said. \u201cSomething she\u2019s seen on TikTok, probably. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nToday, at breakfast, she announces that she\u2019s descended from wolves. I swallow hard, recalling a photo of her birth parents. Her brother sniggers and asks if there\u2019s a dead moose in her lunch-box.\n\nShe shows us her new profile on her mobile. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Leaf. I\u2019m a wolf therian.\u201d In the photo, her face tilts forward so close to the camera that the nose appears unnaturally elongated, protruding towards the world with a menacing sneer. Unnervingly her, but different. She\u2019s only twelve. I wonder if she senses the many ways in which that name, those words, could mark a distance between us.\n\nShe nuzzles up. Will I help her to make a tail? Something she can attach to herself and swing side to side. She might wear it to school, she says. Pinned to her uniform. My stomach lurches.\n\n\u201cWhat will the girls say in class?\u201d We\u2019d done our sums and moved her to a new school that term. Small classes, lush grounds might smooth the jagged edges left from her early childhood, before she was legally ours. Whatever it takes.\n\n\u201cCall me names?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m adopted. I\u2019m used to that.\u201d\n\nAs she leaves for school, she looks tiny in her new, too large uniform.\n\nI know exactly where I\u2019ll find some faux fur for her tail.",
