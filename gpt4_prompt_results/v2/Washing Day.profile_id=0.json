    "story": "Andy glared at the damp sock in his hand as if it was the root of all problems. His other grey socks, along with his white vests and shirts, pleated trousers and frayed Y-fronts, covered every available space on the radiators of the silent semi-detached. This one was missing its other half and the very thought gnawed at him.\n\nAndy fruitlessly searched the empty washing basket, the unmopped kitchen floor, the deserted hallway. Even the sink, full of dirty mugs, plates and cutlery. The tap dripping. The smell of stale bread. He peered inside the washing machine, then rummaged its dark cavern with a hand that grasped nothing. It had to be in there, somewhere.\n\nHis jeans felt tight. Had he put on weight or had they shrunk? Andy questioned whether he\u2019d been using the machine correctly. A particular memory floated above the others weighing down his mind. He opened the filter cover, pulled out the thin tube that was curled up snake-like inside and drained the residual water into a spaghetti-smeared bowl. Then removed the debris filter. A stray sock had once caught inside, causing a nasty blockage, but there was nothing there now.\n\nScratching his paunch, Andy stared at the washing machine. An idea blossomed. A voice told him not to do it, but he was able to ignore it. He found his screwdriver, wrench, and hammer. He knew he was no good with his hands, he\u2019d been told often enough, but was willing to give it a go \u2014 to at least try \u2014 to solve the mystery.\n\nAndy pulled out the plug, turned the stop tap and disconnected the water supply hose. He wrestled with the contraption for several grunting minutes until it was out in the open, exposed. The most exercise he\u2019d had in years. Then he set to work.\n\nSlowly, methodically, he took the bulky device apart piece by piece. It felt satisfying, dismantling it, getting inside to the heart of how it works. The porthole staring blankly like a blind eye. The colourful wires entangling the control panel. The hollow silver drum reminiscent of a space capsule. But no sock to be seen. Not a garment of any description amid the debris.\n\nSocks can\u2019t just evaporate like love can, he thought. They can\u2019t vanish as if part of a magician\u2019s cheap trick. They\u2019re always around, somewhere. They don\u2019t just walk out on you, never to be seen again.\n\n\u201cFucking socks,\u201d he muttered.\n\nTwisting the gold ring on his fourth finger, Andy surveyed the kitchen. The washing machine was gone, broken down into dozens of singular parts scattered across the cold lino, useless on their own. Realising with a painful jolt that he had no idea how to put it back together again, Andy sank to his knees and sobbed.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nWashing Day\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nAndy glared at the damp sock in his hand as if it was the root of all problems.
