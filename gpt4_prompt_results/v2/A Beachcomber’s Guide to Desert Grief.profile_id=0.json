    "story": "The boy on his bike is a shark. Each clump of grass? Seaweed. Each broken crash of cholla? A jellyfish.

But he doesn\u2019t. He rolls up next to you and stops, hovering there with his sharp fin, scenting for blood.\n\nYou\u2019re here to feel the salt spray on your face, taste the tang of summer on your lips, sense the sun shimmering on water. You\u2019re here to listen, and he\u2019s ruining it.\n\nDoesn\u2019t he know that each inch of this ocean is a cure? That time is held in each grain of sand? That if you get quiet enough, the seashells will whisper your sister\u2019s secrets to you?\n\nThey might, but not with him here.\n\nThe cool of his shadow falls across your face. His breath is root beer soda and barbecue sauce.\n\nYou play at being invisible until he touches you, until his words bubble to the surface.\n\n\u2018Not dead,\u2019 he says and laughs.\n\nWhen you open your eyes, you see his bike tire as a whale\u2019s eye.
