    "story": "Mum is late as usual, so Susan and I sit in the car listening to the radio. I tap my toe against the plastic floor mat and stare out the window.\n\n\u201cDo you want to talk?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cUgh. No,\u201d I say, suddenly worried she\u2019s going to try to have some kind of awkward-arse heart-to-heart with me, like this is a Hollywood movie.\n\nIn the Hollywood version of my life, Mum would probably never show up at all, and I would cry at first, but then Susan would hug me and I would magically forget all about Mum and live happily ever after in an immaculately clean house where dinner is on the table at six on the dot every night.\n\nIn this version, I bite my fingernail and glance sideways at Susan.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a total loser you know,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s just that she can\u2019t leave work until her replacement comes in, and sometimes her car doesn\u2019t start the first time. It\u2019s not\u2026you know.\u201d I wave my arm at the plush seats of Susan\u2019s SUV.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a loser,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s trying her best.\u201d Susan is especially calm on visitation days. Like she\u2019s trying to make up for how Mum will be when it\u2019s over, always crying and pulling me back for one last hug. It\u2019s not that Susan doesn\u2019t care, but she\u2019s not really my Mum, is she? When she drops me off, she just smiles encouragingly and waves goodbye. Although, she always stays to watch until I\u2019m gone.\n\nI keep staring out the window. Breathing the soft lavender of Susan\u2019s perfume. I need to see Mum before she sees me. The thing is, It\u2019s been a while since our last visit, and I keep trying to picture her face, but it never looks quite right. Like her eyes will be blue instead of hazel, or her crooked smile will be replaced with straight white teeth like Susan\u2019s. And every time, I know something\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t put all the right pieces of her face together at one time.\n\nThen I see her. She\u2019s walking towards us, wearing a pink coat.  I scan up and down. She\u2019s pulled her dark hair back in a tidy ponytail and her trousers look clean and pressed. I exhale, and I can feel my shoulders relaxing. I turn to Susan.\n\n\u201cThanks for waiting. I\u2019ll see you this afternoon.\u201d\n\nI go to open the door, but she reaches over and squeezes my hand in her soft pink palm. Waits for me to look up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my phone on,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nThen I\u2019m walking toward Mum. She looks nervous, but she\u2019s smiling, and when I hug her she smells familiar, like oranges and vanilla. I look over her shoulder and see Susan smiling and waving through the car window. As Mum and I walk away, I turn and glance back. Susan is still there.",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nSusan is There\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nMum is late as usual, so Susan and I sit in the car listening to the radio.
