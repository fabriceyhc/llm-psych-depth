It was becoming harder and harder to get a good job, so much had changed. So many legal forms to sign. Oceans of politically correct hoops to jump through. Proof of this, proof of that. Where would it end.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what we would do. There was some money stashed away, and we all had ready bags packed, just in case. But still, I had hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this. I had hoped they wouldn\u2019t ask me to do the one thing I could never do. Once I went down this road though there would be no going back.It was happening everywhere now and so many people were losing their jobs. Because of minority groups, things had changed dramatically. Even the people I worked with where so different from when I had started here 15 years ago. My girls weren\u2019t that young any more at 11 and 12. Although this would test them to the limit. I hoped I had done my job properly. They were both kind and compassionate. I had warned them this day might come, and told them to be ready.Was I crazy.\n\nHow could I jeopardise everyone like this. But how could I not. I was continually being told, these are the rules now, if you want to keep your job, you must comply, but what they were asking me to do, what they were asking all of us to do, was unthinkable and I couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t agree. It wasn\u2019t right.I considered carefully then, what I would need. There was ample provisions in the supply room next door. I needed to hurry though. Glancing around, I slipped into the room and quickly appropriated all I could from the drawers and cabinets and threw everything in a drawstring bag. Then, heart pounding, I grabbed my mobile and made the phone call.\n\nNext, I checked the hallway. No one. I suspected they wanted to distance themselves. Cowards. Out of sight out of mind, seemed to be how everyone avoided the moral disgrace but at least their absence made it easier for me to do what I must.Just do it and be quick I had been told. But no, never. It was beyond imagining. Carefully I approached the bench. So innocent, so pure. So unsuspecting. The syringe full of life stealing liquid sat in a metal tray next to the cot, awaiting my compliance. My tears nearly blinded me as I choked back sobs and gently gathered the tiny 34 week new born baby girl, who was very much alive, into my arms. I stared at her perfect tiny face and knew I was making the right decision. I would never comply.\n\nWrapping her gently and holding her tightly against my chest , I fled down the back stairs of the hospital to my car, praying they wouldn\u2019t notice I was gone, for quite some time.

    "authentic_explanation": "The story captures a tangible sense of urgency and desperation that many people might feel in extreme situations, especially regarding the decision surrounding the baby.

    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The characters in the story, especially the protagonist, do seem to have depth, with evident internal conflicts. However, many elements of the story's backdrop are touched upon only superficially. There's a sense of oversimplification, especially regarding the societal changes and the roles of 'minority groups.' The motivations of other characters in the story are also not explored in depth.",
