    "story": "Caroline Richardson hasn\u2019t moved for seven years. Today is her thirteenth birthday, but she\u2019s still only five years old.\n\nWhen it rains, she\u2019s beneath the puddles she would have liked to jump in. When the sun shines, it can\u2019t reach her face to warm it. She can\u2019t gather the conkers and chestnuts that fall above her. Golden autumn leaves reach the ground without being caught and wished upon. For seven winters, the snowmen have been left unbuilt, lying flat above her.\n\nBrian Marchant has hardly moved for seven years. At the age of sixty-one, he\u2019d confessed, but refused to reveal her location. The thought that keeps him going is that he will die before they find her.  \n\nWhen it rains, he remembers the day he caught himself a pretty butterfly. The sun reminds him of the sunburn across his shoulders when he\u2019d stripped to the waist to dig her grave. Bloody, autumn leaves pirouette past his cell window, taunting him with their freedom. When it snows, he turns his dead eyes to the sky and stares into the grey abyss of winter without regret.\n\nMegan Richardson is always twenty-eight years old. Her life stopped the day her daughter disappeared. She often cries with the rain. The sun\u2019s rays never penetrate the darkness she\u2019s in. Leaves are torn from the trees in Autumn, just as her baby was torn from her. She sees her daughter\u2019s face in the snowflakes and hears her laughter in the icy wind. She\u2019s now a mother only to her grief, which latched itself onto her breast and feeds off her.\n\nAs the diggers move in to clear the overgrown patch of land at the back of the new housing estate, Megan\u2019s kitchen clock starts ticking. It stopped seven years ago. She clutches the back of a chair and tries to stop herself from falling. Somehow, she knows, today is the day.\n\nRoots are ripped from the ground and saplings knocked aside. The bramble covered scar is about to be torn open. Brian Marchant feels the first shock wave down his left arm and falls to his knees clutching his chest.  \n\nRumbling closer, the huge machines cuts through the earth. Caroline slowly turns in her grave and is lifted upwards.  \n\nThe seven-year spell is about to break.",

Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nThe Seven Year Spell\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nCaroline Richardson hasn\u2019t moved for seven years.
