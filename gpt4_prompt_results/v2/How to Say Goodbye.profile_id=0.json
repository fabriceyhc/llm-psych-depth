    "story": "The first thing you need to do is make sure you have a pair of sunglasses.  Not one of those pairs where you can see through the lens.  A reflective pair, the kind that hides your eyes.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to have them on before it starts.  When he asks you to take them off, all you will have to do is shake your head.  He won\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking. \n\nYou\u2019ll be thinking lots of things.  Like: if he touches me, I\u2019ll slap him.  Why won\u2019t he just leave?  I don\u2019t want him here.  What if my neighbors hear this conversation?  What would it feel like if we hugged?  And what would happen after we hugged? \n\n Your thoughts may drift toward the banal.  Is it street sweeping day?  Did I park my car on the wrong side of the street?  Did I take my recycling out this morning?  What\u2019s on my \u2018to-do\u2019 list?  Why is he still here?\n\n He will still be standing there, and you\u2019ll know that he is wondering what you\u2019re thinking.  That\u2019s where the glasses come in.  Keep them on, and he won\u2019t see.  He won\u2019t see your anger or hurt or fear.  You will see his.  And you won\u2019t really like it.  It will feel unfair.  You\u2019ll think that you always did like to look into his eyes but for him to ask you to take your glasses off now, given everything, just shows how dumb he is.  Why won\u2019t he just go? \n\nThe funny thing about saying goodbye is that, sometimes, you never even really say goodbye.  A person, a past life, just kind of drifts away.  Like a boat floating away with the tide.  Not moving fast enough to really seem like it\u2019s going anywhere.  But then it\u2019s gone entirely, as if it had never been there.  Except for in the memory of those who marked where it once was. \n\nBut some goodbyes are more abrupt and dramatic.  Like this one.  You\u2019ll see the way something seems to break in him as he looks at you before he gets into his car.  Wasn\u2019t he just on your porch, trying to see through your glasses?  Now he\u2019s driving away.\n\nYou\u2019re not thinking about him, but you are.  One of your selves steps inside but another one is out there in the street, screaming at him to keep driving.  Another one has sprinted up the block and is standing in front of his car at the intersection, hands on his hood, telling him that you changed your mind, that he should stay. \n\nYour house will be the same but not the same.  Stay inside, you\u2019ll tell yourself.  Just stay inside.  You\u2019ll find things there.\n\nLike the cool tile on the kitchen floor, where you can lay down and curl up and cry and try to not think about the time that your naked back was pressed against that same floor, his warm body on top of yours.",

Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nHow to Say Goodbye\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nThe first thing you need to do is make sure you have a pair of sunglasses.
