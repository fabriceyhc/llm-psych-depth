He squeals with delight as she holds it to her lips and blows away the tiny cloud with each puff of air:\n\n\u201cOne o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock, three, four, five\u2026 Dinner time!\u201d\n\nThey tumble in the overgrown grass, amongst the seed heads which wait like little ticking time-bombs. Bang \u2013 she is pregnant. Boom \u2013 Gary leaves her, muttering about not being able to turn back the clock. Her life detonates. Now she must care for her son, who only sees his dad on alternate weekends, and go to work, and cook, and clean, and make time for endless chores. Every time she looks at a clock she thinks it must be lying about how much time has passed, or how little.\n\nThis weekend it is her turn to have Leo, who woke at dawn and refused to accept it wasn\u2019t morning. He plays, and she sits on the step with another coffee. She had expected sleepless nights but assumed that they would end \u2013 perhaps nine or ten months of disruption \u2013 then, by the time her maternity leave ended, Leo would be sleeping through. Instead, at eighteen months old, Leo has not given her a single night of unbroken sleep and she wakes at unearthly hours even when he is not there. She is living out of time, as though permanently jet-lagged. She thinks of her bed and of how soon she can get Leo down for a nap and then talks herself out of that dream; she must cut the lawn or it will grow even more unmanageable \u2013 already it is choked with dandelions and countless other weeds. Mowing was Gary\u2019s job.\n\nLeo starts to wail. He is opening and closing his fists in bewilderment and it takes a while to solve the problem \u2013 he has dropped the dandelion he picked for her. After much consideration he finds a substitute and proudly hands it over.\n\n\u201cOne o\u2019clock, two o\u2019clock\u2026\u201d\n\nTogether they travel through the markers of the day, past breakfast, snack, lunch and dinner, the remaining seeds clinging on obstinately. Finally, she brings her hand up, like a magician, and when it falls the stalk is empty.\n\n\u201cTen o\u2019clock \u2013 bedtime.\u201d\n\nShe carries Leo upstairs before he has time to protest. Eventually, his breathing slows and his hand, sticky with sap, releases her own.\n\nBack outside the air has grown warmer and she really should cut the grass while it is dry, but instead she lies down in it and closes her eyes. She is a child again, one for whom time has no authority. The drone of a mower starts up a few gardens away and close to her ear there is the answering buzz of a bee. She imagines Leo waking up to find the clocks have lost their faces. And for what? Because someone, a long time ago, decided that these beautiful plants were weeds? She sits up, chooses a clock and blows. It is her time now.",
    "prompt_to_run": "\nYou are a renowned literary critic known for your incisive and rigorous analysis.\nYour expertise lies in the study of psychological depth in literature.\nYour reputation is built on your ability to assess writing with both precision and fairness.\nYou aren't easily swayed by superficial charm and always prioritize substance over style.\nYou believe very strongly that the only way to be kind and compassionate to a writer is\nto provide honest and constructive feedback, especially when there is room for improvement.\nOffer feedback that is candid and honest, but also constructive.\n\n\n**Task**:\n---------\n\nYour task is composed of the following steps:\n1. Review the given components of psychological depth: authenticity, emotion\nprovoking, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Be sure to understand\neach concept and the questions that characterize them.\n2. Read a given story, paying special attention to components of psychological depth.\n3. Think step by step and explain the degree to which each component of psychological\ndepth is evident in the story.\n4. Assign a rating for each component from 1 to 5. 1 is greatly below average, 3 is\naverage and 5 is greatly above average (should be rare to provide this score).\n\n\n**Evaluation Components**:\n-------------------------\n\nFor our purposes, psychological depth is composed of the following concepts, each illustrated by several questions:\n\n- Authenticity\n\t- Does the writing feel true to real human experiences?\n\t- Does it represent psychological processes in a way that feels authentic and believable?\n- Emotion Provoking\n\t- How well does the writing depict emotional experiences?\n\t- Does it explore the nuances of the characters' emotional states, rather than just describing them in simple terms?\n\t- Can the writing show rather than tell a wide variety of emotions?\n\t- Do the emotions that are shown in the text make sense in the context of the story?\n- Empathy\n\t- Do you feel like you were able to empathize with the characters and situations in the text?\n\t- Do you feel that the text led you to introspection, or to new insights about yourself or the world?\"\n- Engagement\n\t- Does the text engage you on an emotional and psychological level?\n\t- Do you feel the need to keep reading as you read the text?\n- Narrative Complexity\n\t- Do the characters in the story have multifaceted personalities? Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nNone of The Clocks Tell the Right Time\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nLeo is transfixed by the perfectly spherical, white globe.
