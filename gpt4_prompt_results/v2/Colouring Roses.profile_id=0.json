    "story": "Another letter from school. I handed it over to Mum and looked at the stains on the kitchen floor. When she had finished reading she said I had to control my anger.  \u2018Where are your listening ears?\u2019\n\nI\u2019m ten not five. I didn\u2019t say this I just mumbled \u2018sorry,\u2019 before hurrying to my bedroom.\n\nThen I had my idea. I would lock my anger away.\n\nSo where to put it. Dad\u2019s tennis racket case? No he would find it and then there would be trouble. It had to be somewhere safe. Dad was cross enough without having my anger too.\n\nIn my bedroom I found my old plastic chest under the bed. The one I used to store my pet worms in. Would it be large enough to contain my anger?\n\nI sat on my bed and concentrated. I held the box close to my mouth, breathed in and out like my teacher had told me. When I had no breath left I shut the lid. I pictured my anger bright red like Dad\u2019s cheeks when he yelled at Mum.\n\nNow where to put it? I didn\u2019t want my little brother finding it \u2013 he had enough temper tantrums. Somewhere high then, but what if Mum found it? It would make her sad and she cried enough already especially when Dad came home late slurring his words.\n\nThe garden. The overgrown spot at the end. The patch where Dad had promised to build a climbing frame. I was too old for climbing frames now.\n\nI started to dig with my brother\u2019s plastic spade.\n\nI imagined my anger bubbling like a saucepan on the cooker when Mum cooked us pasta.\n\nThe stupid spade broke.\n\nMy anger would have escaped if it wasn\u2019t for Mrs P calling out, \u2018digging for treasure, pet?\u2019 I wiped my hands down my jeans. Dad called Mrs P a nosey old cow.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s my anger,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m burying it so everyone can be happy, but the ground\u2019s too hard and I\u2019m worried someone will find it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I tell you what. I\u2019ll put it in my garden under the rose bush. What colour is your anger?\u2019\n\n\u2018Red, of course.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well it\u2019ll help to colour my roses \u2013 you wait and see\u2019\n\nI passed the box over the fence, stood on tiptoe and watched her dig. When it was buried, Mrs P gave me a thumbs up.\n\nSoon the rosebush was covered in buds and I smiled at the thought of my anger making something so pretty.\n\nOne day Mrs P cut me a bunch of the roses and wrapped their thorny stems in tinfoil. I gave them to Mum who put them in her last remaining vase. She closed her eyes and sniffed the roses. She smiled for the first time since Dad left.  I saw my anger rise from the blooms and disappear through the open window.",

Are they developed beyond stereotypes or tropes? Do they exhibit internal conflicts?\n\t- Does the writing explore the complexities of relationships between characters?\n\t- Does it delve into the intricacies of conflicts and their partial or complete resolutions?\n\n\n**Story Title**:\n----------------\nColouring Roses\n\n**Story Content**:\n------------------\nAnother letter from school.
