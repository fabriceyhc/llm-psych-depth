    "prompt_to_run": "Imagine you're a professor teaching a course on psychological literature. You've spent years analyzing the intricacies of characters, emotions, and the human psyche as portrayed in literature. Your task is to evaluate the writing in front of you based on its psychological depth, considering factors such as authenticity, emotion provocation, empathy, engagement, and narrative complexity. Rate each component on a scale of 1-5 based on the depth and nuance with which the writing addresses them.\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.
