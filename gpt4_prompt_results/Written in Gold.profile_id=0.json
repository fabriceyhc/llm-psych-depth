But no. The cereal makes you thirsty, your drink stains the rug, and don\u2019t even ask me where you\u2019ve managed to hide the peanut butter. Thank goodness your father isn\u2019t allergic to nuts. Oh wait, he is!\n\nI can dust, do the washing, load the dishwasher, weed the garden, but I can\u2019t sit. I\u2019m not allowed to sit. As soon as my bum hits that couch you snatch my pen and run away laughing. You scribble over my pristine, cherished, and favourite notebooks. You need your \u2018packpack\u2019 put on your \u2018backback\u2019 then and there because you\u2019re going to the shops for more \u2018weeties\u2019.\n\nYou absorb my time and creativity and demand it as your own. I take you to soft play; help you find friends, but you\u2019re back every two minutes asking why I\u2019m not ankle-deep in the ball pit like that other mum. Does she have a book to write? Or deadlines that pass without a word hitting the page?\n\nOn the calendar, I mark off the days until you start school, the days until I can become more than just \u2018Mummy\u2019, \u2018the wife of that guy whose clothes are never ironed\u2019, and \u2018that part-time employee with the uncombed hair\u2019.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, you give me a card. Handmade. Your name scribbled inside in yellow felt tip. It\u2019s got two extra \u2018a\u2019s and a \u20182\u2019 I don\u2019t remember giving it, but it\u2019s there, clear to a mother\u2019s eye. The first proper word you\u2019ve written. And I realize, it\u2019s better than anything I will ever write. The best thing I could ever create sits staring at me from the rug, your eyes the colour of mine, your energy boundless, and all you want is my time, my love, and my whole being.\n\nIt\u2019s worth every second I have just to see you grow.",

    "authentic_score": "4",
    "authentic_explanation": "The depiction of a mother's struggle to find time for herself and her passion amidst the daily duties and challenges of raising a child feels genuine. The narrative, with its casual mentions of household chores, tantrums, and endearing mispronunciations, resonates with the real experiences many parents face. However, the sudden realization at the end, while heartfelt, might feel a touch melodramatic for some readers, slightly diminishing its authenticity.",
    "emotion_provoking_score": "4.5",
    "emotion_provoking_explanation": "The story does an excellent job of portraying the emotional turbulence that the protagonist feels: frustration, fatigue, love, and pride all weave together in a short span. The card scene, especially with the child's first written word, is a potent symbol of parenthood's joys, outshining the daily irritations.",
    "empathy_score": "5",
    "empathy_explanation": "Most readers, especially those who are parents, will deeply empathize with the protagonist. The vivid details—whether it's the child mispronouncing words or the comparison with another parent at the play area—make it easy to step into the shoes of the character.",
    "engagement_score": "4",
    "engagement_explanation": "The day-to-day chaos of parenting is captured in a relatable way, keeping readers hooked. But the story's brevity, while maintaining its charm, may leave some readers wanting a deeper dive into the protagonist's life, desires, and aspirations.",
    "narrative_complexity_score": "3",
    "narrative_complexity_explanation": "The narrative is straightforward, detailing a slice-of-life portrayal of a writer-turned-mother who is trying to balance her personal desires with the demands of parenting. While it touches upon the profound realizations that come with parenthood, there's limited exploration of underlying complexities or subplots."
