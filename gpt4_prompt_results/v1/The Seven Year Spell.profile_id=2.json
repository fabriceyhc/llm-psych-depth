    "story": "Caroline Richardson hasn\u2019t moved for seven years. Today is her thirteenth birthday, but she\u2019s still only five years old.\n\nWhen it rains, she\u2019s beneath the puddles she would have liked to jump in. When the sun shines, it can\u2019t reach her face to warm it. She can\u2019t gather the conkers and chestnuts that fall above her. Golden autumn leaves reach the ground without being caught and wished upon. For seven winters, the snowmen have been left unbuilt, lying flat above her.\n\nBrian Marchant has hardly moved for seven years. At the age of sixty-one, he\u2019d confessed, but refused to reveal her location. The thought that keeps him going is that he will die before they find her.  \n\nWhen it rains, he remembers the day he caught himself a pretty butterfly. The sun reminds him of the sunburn across his shoulders when he\u2019d stripped to the waist to dig her grave. Bloody, autumn leaves pirouette past his cell window, taunting him with their freedom. When it snows, he turns his dead eyes to the sky and stares into the grey abyss of winter without regret.\n\nMegan Richardson is always twenty-eight years old. Her life stopped the day her daughter disappeared. She often cries with the rain. The sun\u2019s rays never penetrate the darkness she\u2019s in. Leaves are torn from the trees in Autumn, just as her baby was torn from her. She sees her daughter\u2019s face in the snowflakes and hears her laughter in the icy wind. She\u2019s now a mother only to her grief, which latched itself onto her breast and feeds off her.\n\nAs the diggers move in to clear the overgrown patch of land at the back of the new housing estate, Megan\u2019s kitchen clock starts ticking. It stopped seven years ago. She clutches the back of a chair and tries to stop herself from falling. Somehow, she knows, today is the day.\n\nRoots are ripped from the ground and saplings knocked aside. The bramble covered scar is about to be torn open. Brian Marchant feels the first shock wave down his left arm and falls to his knees clutching his chest.  \n\nRumbling closer, the huge machines cuts through the earth. Caroline slowly turns in her grave and is lifted upwards.  \n\nThe seven-year spell is about to break.",
