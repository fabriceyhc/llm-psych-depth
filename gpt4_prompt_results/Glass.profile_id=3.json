Mom always says that a test is just to help the teacher see if the teaching is working, or if there are gaps. The test is more about the teacher, not you. She always says that. When she\u2019s talking, and I\u2019m sitting in the car beside her, I believe her, and it\u2019s the truth. Then we get to school, and I put on my coat and my smile, wave to her, and she takes the truth away with her in the car. I\u2019m left looking for friends as she indicates and pulls away and disappears into the traffic. And then I must go in.\n\nFirst class; maths. I breathe all the way down to my ankles and turn the page. Everything makes sense in class, the words and numbers flowing. Then we are cut loose, and left to work through the examples, and it\u2019s like swimming too far out to sea: the edges become more distant, more indistinct. A wave of panic breaks over me, leaving my sweating fingertips icy against the table. They are as confused as I am.\n\nBreathe. Push it down. Don\u2019t let anyone see. Don\u2019t let anyone in. Never ask.\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst thing, mom always asks; what\u2019s the very worst thing that could happen if you don\u2019t know the answer. I don\u2019t know, I always mutter back. The truth is, I do know. I can see exactly what happens. The thing is, I\u2019m invisible. Mom wouldn\u2019t understand that. I\u2019m made of glass. Light shines through me, catching on my rough edges and shimmering all the colours of the rainbow. Everyone sees the colours, but not the glass. If I change that, if I put up my hand, then the crystal becomes opaque, the colours vanish, and everyone can see how thick and cloudy my brain is. I wake up at night, picturing their clown-faces looming into mine, fairground-loud and leering. Telling me I\u2019m stupid, stupid, stupid. Telling me I\u2019m nothing. If I let the voices in, I\u2019d have to cut the voices out. Better to keep them out. Better to stay light, and bright, like glass.\n\nBreathe.\n\nBreathe.\n\nBreathe.\n\nJamie has his hand up. Please miss, please sir, please miss. Jamie always has his hand up. There\u2019s a small tide of laughter through the room. The teacher gives the class a dead-eye stare and the laughter drifts into the corner. Yes, Jamie? she says, in a very ordinary voice that is calm, and patient. Jamie asks, and she explains, and the air held tight in my lungs flows out, and warmth and understanding flow back into me.\n\nMom says we all have the same feelings, but I wonder do the clowns come for Jamie in the night? Is he so much braver? Maybe next time, I\u2019ll put up my hand. Maybe. The bell rings.\n\nPush it down. All the way down. Five classes until home-time.",
