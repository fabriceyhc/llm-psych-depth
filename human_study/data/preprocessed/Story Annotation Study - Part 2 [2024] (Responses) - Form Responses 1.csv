The writing of this story signaled something human to me because of how the vampire's feelings were conveyed. You could tell that he yearned to know what the sun was like but couldn't due to his nature. It felt as if this story had to be written by a human.,3,,2,,3,,2,,2,,3,,,3,,4,,3,,3,,3,,3,,,3,,3,,2,,2,,2,,3,,I have trouble believing this was written by a human because I'm not understanding how the alien forms a connection with the two humans they met. I also don't see how helping these people was a part of the alien's mission because all they do is feed on dreams. The story doesn't delve enough into the connection between the characters so there's a lack of emotional connection I have with the story and leads me towards the story feeling more like it was written by AI. ,4,,5,,3,,4,,4,,4,"The text was very closely related to aspects of the real world that I resonant with on an emotional level. It detailed some of the most unfortunate parts of our world and the use of repetition is almost like how a poem is written. It is a literary device typically used to emphasize a key point. Thus, I'm very inclined to believe that this was written by a human.",,4,,4,,3,,4,,4,,4,,,4,,4,,3,,4,,3,,3,,,2,,3,,2,,2,,2,,2,,,4,,4,,3,,3,,4,,4,,,4,,5,,4,,4,,4,,4,,,4,,3,,3,,4,,3,,4,,,4,,4,,4,,4,,3,,4,,
