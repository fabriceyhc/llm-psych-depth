Stories displaying highly imaginative and unconventional elements, complex emotional nuances, or intricate narrative structures were more likely attributed to human authors, as they demonstrated a depth of understanding and creativity that I think surpassed LLM capabilities.",5,I think the annotation process was effective.,"Just a couple, but those were mainly due to the google form having an undisclosed word count that I just had to figure out myself before it let me continue. ","I thought many of the stories were enjoyable, some more complex and some that were comically entertaining. ",5
12/3/2023 14:47:28,7,2,"It took me probably a little more than 8 hours, but I did provide explanations for the first three sections and most of the fourth one. I did not add explanations for the fifth section, and that went much quicker, so I think I would have been around the 5 hour mark had I not done explanations at all. ",Yes,Maybe,4,"Yes! If emotions were portrayed in a way that I think matched how a human would write about them or would feel in general, then I said it was pretty authentic. For pieces that I suspected to be AI, if there wasn't any mention of how the characters were feeling or how they acted, then I said it wasn't authentic.",3,"Some of the stories barely introduced the characters, so I didn't feel empathy with those. Otherwise, if the story did a pretty good job at describing their characters or scene, I was more likely to feel empathetic.",4,"I kept to more basic emotions like happiness and sadness, but if a story had fleshed out characters who took twists and turns within the storyline, I was more likely to feel moved than if the characters were barely introduced. ","Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Confusion",5,"If there was any style in the writing, then I was more likely to be engaged with it as I like when stories are able to create a scene with a lot of characteristics. Also, if the characters were complicated, I was more likely to want to see where the author was going to go with the story. ",4,"I was looking for how a character changed overtime. With the character limit, obviously, there's not going to be a lot of change, and if there was, this was suspicious to me. But, if they had a realization or were revealed to be more complex than their initial portrayal, I though the story to show narrative complexity. Also, if the story did not follow the plotline that I immediately thought of when I read the prompt, I rated it to be more narratively complex as they were using creativity. ",4,"I noticed a pattern in pieces that I thought were AI. They would usually resolve the conflict very abruptly or in too positive of a way for the context of the situation. There would also be a lesson that they would try to have us digest at the end of the story, which I don't think a human would usually have us do. I think a human would usually just end the story on a cohesive note. ",5,Maybe express or elaborate on the importance of the optional explanations and how they would be used in the study.,No,No,4
12/3/2023 16:48:18,6,4,"I didn't keep tracking, but somewhere between 8-10.5 hours.",Yes,No,3,"Authenticity was the most difficult metric for me to consider with each story. Generally, I considered the emotional processes described and tried to ascertain how I or someone I know would react in a similar situation. However, sometimes it was hard to do it like this because the story was so cheesy.",5,"If they talked like how an actual real human would reflect on their emotions, I was more likely to feel empathy.",4,,"Joy, Fear, Anger, Hope, Admiration",5,"The least engaging stories were walls of description with little to no dialogue, all just telling your the story rather than showing it.",4,,4,,5,I really would've liked a progress bar on the bottom of the form to see how many stories I had left in a given part.,"Some stories were cut off, didn't have paragraph separations, or had miscellaneous text that wasn't actually part of the story.",You guys are doing really important research! Thank you!,4
12/3/2023 20:14:04,2,2,6-7 hours in total,Yes,No,4,When the story speaks to the realistic human experience or psyche. ,5,When the story is able to relate to emotionally connect to the reader(s).,5,When the story is able to use specific writing techniques and language to sincerely evoke emotion. The AI could not achieve this as easily compared to human-written stories since the former felt formulaic and copy-pasted. ,"Surprise, Pity, Confusion",5,The story's ability to keep the reader's engaged depended largely on the form of writing (for me). AI written stories felt formulaic and lack-luster. ,5,Ai generated stories struggled to be complex or offer anything new/surprising. ,5,"AI written stories had a specific form and defining characteristics. Usually had some generic first-last name protagonist(s), the story taking on the prompt's conflict literally within its narrative. Human-written stories tended to vary more in form, style, structure, voice, and were generally more unique and engaging. ",4,Include page numbers to know how many stories you have left to annotate,none,"""Authenticity"" felt like a very vague metric compared to emotional provocation, etc. , so it was at times difficult to gauge",5

The endings were also too neat, almost like fables. The stories that I thought were more obviously written by humans had a sense of humour and sarcasm and references to pop culture. ",5,No suggestions. I especially found the 1-5 scale useful and easy to rate the stories. It alleviated all of the pressure of having to decide if it's strictly AI or human. ,None. ,"I honestly thought it would be very easy to differentiate between which stories were written by AI versus humans, but considering the specificity of the prompts and conciseness of the stories I was impressed by the similarities between the stories and actually realize that AI writes pretty decent stories, though they are very simplistic. Along the way I began to notice more patterns between some stories that I thought to be written by AI such as the structuring of the stories and use of cliches. ",5
