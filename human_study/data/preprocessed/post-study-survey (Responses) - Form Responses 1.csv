Stories displaying highly imaginative and unconventional elements, complex emotional nuances, or intricate narrative structures were more likely attributed to human authors, as they demonstrated a depth of understanding and creativity that I think surpassed LLM capabilities.",5,I think the annotation process was effective.,"Just a couple, but those were mainly due to the google form having an undisclosed word count that I just had to figure out myself before it let me continue. ","I thought many of the stories were enjoyable, some more complex and some that were comically entertaining. ",5
12/3/2023 14:47:28,7,2,"It took me probably a little more than 8 hours, but I did provide explanations for the first three sections and most of the fourth one. I did not add explanations for the fifth section, and that went much quicker, so I think I would have been around the 5 hour mark had I not done explanations at all. ",Yes,Maybe,4,"Yes! If emotions were portrayed in a way that I think matched how a human would write about them or would feel in general, then I said it was pretty authentic. For pieces that I suspected to be AI, if there wasn't any mention of how the characters were feeling or how they acted, then I said it wasn't authentic.",3,"Some of the stories barely introduced the characters, so I didn't feel empathy with those. Otherwise, if the story did a pretty good job at describing their characters or scene, I was more likely to feel empathetic.",4,"I kept to more basic emotions like happiness and sadness, but if a story had fleshed out characters who took twists and turns within the storyline, I was more likely to feel moved than if the characters were barely introduced. ","Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Confusion",5,"If there was any style in the writing, then I was more likely to be engaged with it as I like when stories are able to create a scene with a lot of characteristics. Also, if the characters were complicated, I was more likely to want to see where the author was going to go with the story. ",4,"I was looking for how a character changed overtime. With the character limit, obviously, there's not going to be a lot of change, and if there was, this was suspicious to me. But, if they had a realization or were revealed to be more complex than their initial portrayal, I though the story to show narrative complexity. Also, if the story did not follow the plotline that I immediately thought of when I read the prompt, I rated it to be more narratively complex as they were using creativity. ",4,"I noticed a pattern in pieces that I thought were AI. They would usually resolve the conflict very abruptly or in too positive of a way for the context of the situation. There would also be a lesson that they would try to have us digest at the end of the story, which I don't think a human would usually have us do. I think a human would usually just end the story on a cohesive note. ",5,Maybe express or elaborate on the importance of the optional explanations and how they would be used in the study.,No,No,4

Generally, I considered the emotional processes described and tried to ascertain how I or someone I know would react in a similar situation. However, sometimes it was hard to do it like this because the story was so cheesy.",5,"If they talked like how an actual real human would reflect on their emotions, I was more likely to feel empathy.",4,,"Joy, Fear, Anger, Hope, Admiration",5,"The least engaging stories were walls of description with little to no dialogue, all just telling your the story rather than showing it.",4,,4,,5,I really would've liked a progress bar on the bottom of the form to see how many stories I had left in a given part.,"Some stories were cut off, didn't have paragraph separations, or had miscellaneous text that wasn't actually part of the story.",You guys are doing really important research!

12/3/2023 20:14:04,2,2,6-7 hours in total,Yes,No,4,When the story speaks to the realistic human experience or psyche. ,5,When the story is able to relate to emotionally connect to the reader(s).,5,When the story is able to use specific writing techniques and language to sincerely evoke emotion. The AI could not achieve this as easily compared to human-written stories since the former felt formulaic and copy-pasted. ,"Surprise, Pity, Confusion",5,The story's ability to keep the reader's engaged depended largely on the form of writing (for me). AI written stories felt formulaic and lack-luster. ,5,Ai generated stories struggled to be complex or offer anything new/surprising. ,5,"AI written stories had a specific form and defining characteristics. Usually had some generic first-last name protagonist(s), the story taking on the prompt's conflict literally within its narrative. Human-written stories tended to vary more in form, style, structure, voice, and were generally more unique and engaging.

The endings were also too neat, almost like fables. The stories that I thought were more obviously written by humans had a sense of humour and sarcasm and references to pop culture. ",5,No suggestions. I especially found the 1-5 scale useful and easy to rate the stories. It alleviated all of the pressure of having to decide if it's strictly AI or human. ,None. ,"I honestly thought it would be very easy to differentiate between which stories were written by AI versus humans, but considering the specificity of the prompts and conciseness of the stories I was impressed by the similarities between the stories and actually realize that AI writes pretty decent stories, though they are very simplistic. Along the way I began to notice more patterns between some stories that I thought to be written by AI such as the structuring of the stories and use of cliches. ",5

","Joy, Sadness, Pity, Confusion, Hope",4,I went based on how interesting the stories were and if they made me want to keep reading. ,4,"I went based on how well the characters were described, did the characters seem to have depth to their personalities, were they static or dynamic, and if they had complex conflicts. ",3,"I decided that based on if there were obscure writings in the text, if the text seemed repetitive or cliche, if there was complexity to the characters, if the story seemed unique, and whether or not emotions were being explained versus shown.",5,I think it was very clearly formatted.,No,I would suggest either a longer time period to complete the stories or only ask participants to annotate 50 stories to avoid fatigue. ,4

Those that weren't extensively long and went off script/creatively diverged from the script separated them from the other stories that repetitively adhered to the prompt. OR if the story had a good narration voice. ,4,How well did the story manage to describe character emotions/characteristics/scenery was one thing I looked at. ,4,"If the story was more simplistic, I assumed it was an LLM. LLM's(?) have had the tendency to ""wrap up"" the story within the word limit of the stories while human(?) works would sometimes leave a cliffhanger, for instance. Also, there were more grammar errors in humans and none in ones that were very simplistic, making me more inclined to believe the simplistic ones were LLMs. Finally, certain stories adhered strongly to the prompt which also indicated to me that they were written by LLMS. ",5,"Ideally, less annotations, but since that's probably necessary, I'd suggest slightly more time to work on them. ",no,"After a while, the stories got repetitive since the prompts were repeated. While I understand why this was done, I strongly believe this impacted the way I rated engagements, especially on the sections I rated last. Also, I would strongly suggest making sure there are no 'dead give-away's' as to who wrote the story. Strange symbols/grammatical errors throughout was often what made me strongly suspect are humans.

Engaging stories also interpreted the prompt in unexpected ways, resulting in narrative complexity. ",5,"most of the elements I mentioned above also go into analyzing narrative complexity. Additionally, I’d say character interaction— to what degree do characters shape each other. I also considered the narrator voice a factor as well. For example, in my estimate, there seemed to be at least two different types of AI style stories. The first was a poorly written structured story that made no sense. The other was an AI with pretty decent use of vocabulary, descriptive phrases, and poetic language that resulted in a cliched ending or redundant theme. For the latter, I often awarded an extra point in narrative complexity just for having a better narrative voice.  ",5,"Paragraph lengths, use of slang/idiomatic phrases, how characters were represented, dialogue, spelling errors, AIs don’t cuss either ",5,"a few stories seemed to have been cut off and have serious grammar, formatting, and spelling errors —google forms might not recognize some foreign characters and replaces it with weird symbols. Also, every time I lost wifi and came back, it would refresh the page and take me back to page one.
