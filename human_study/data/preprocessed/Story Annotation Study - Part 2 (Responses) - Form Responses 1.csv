12/2/2023 0:24:11,7,1,Cyberbullying is a real fact. I don't know that someone could just rise above it.,3,Feel sad for the vampire. But everything is okay towards the end.,2,Not much variation in style or much going on in the story.,2,Felt a little sad for the vampire knowing this is something people can experience in the real world.,2,"Not much to the characters in general, follow trope of bullies and the bullied person just being okay afterwards.",5,"The writing style is very consistent throughout--too consistent almost. Marcus is also not a name that strikes fear, so I wouldn't use it for a Vampire. ",,1,,1,"We don't know the characters that well as they aren't really given background, so there's not much connection.",1,The storyline is very typical and there's not a lot of variation in the sentences.,1,I didn't really feel moved by this piece as there's not any conflict or storyline to connect to.,2,"One character is revealed to do something out of the norm of their usual behavior, but that's pretty much it.",5,The names are very basic. The story is not fleshed out. There's little to no writing style.,,5,I do think political corruption and power-hungriness is a true thing we experience in this day and age.,2,I feel a little empathetic towards Mcconell as he continues to put on a brave face despite his hardships.,3,"I wasn't too engaged. I think the introduction of Cecil Grant was interesting, though.",1,I wasn't really emotional while reading this.,3,"There's different perspectives added into the story. But, the characters do follow the tropes of the ""good"" and ""bad"" politicians.",3,"The story has kind of a robotic feel to it, but some parts are different like the grammatical mistake with the dash towards the beginning of the paper (it has a space). Also, characters are introduced by their first and last name again.",,3,"I do think that humans would want to retaliate these aliens, but I'm not sure they wouldn't at least consider the 4 hour work day before doing so.",1,I don't really feel connected to any of these characters.,1,"I think the storyline is pretty basic, especially down to the names and plotline.",1,I didn't really connect with this piece.,1,"These characters are all pretty one-dimensional as they all have one goal and don't stray from that, which I don't know how accurate that is.",5,"There are a lot of cliche phrases like ""tornado"" of thoughts and comparing ""rich and poor,"" etc. ",,3,"I think this could happen, a sister could be grieving the death of a sibling. But, I also don't know why they would feel the need to lie about being twins.",3,I feel empathy for the person being lied to as well as the character who's sister was murdered.,1,I didn't find it engaging. I think the storyline was pretty basic and it followed the prompt almost exactly.,2,"I can understand feeling upset if this is something the reader has experienced in their own life, but personally, I did not really connect to this story.",1,"There's a twist about them being twins, but that is asked of in the prompt, so I don't think the characters are very complex.",5,"The first sentence basically repeats what the prompt is asking. There's also the same ""lesson to be learned"" at the end of the piece. ",,2,I think that people are put into situations where they have to choose one person or the other often.,3,I felt a little empathetic in the fact that Sarah had to choose between two relationships she wanted to keep,2,"There were some differences in stylistic elements, but that was kind of it.",2,I don't really feel moved by the story. ,4,I think there's a complexity to the characters. Sarah falls for the monster who is not exactly a typical love or relationship interest. The monster is also revealed to have a kind side.,4,"I think that this is likely written by AI. The phrases ""on one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" indicate that there is an algorithm maybe being used to create conflict.",,1,"I'm not sure that Sarah would have just realized, as an adult, that she and her sister were twins.",1,I didn't feel connected to the character.,1,I didn't really feel engaged as this storyline was cliche.,1,I didn't feel connected to this story as we get no background to the character.,1,"The story is not fleshed out, and the only complexity the plot has is the twins twist, which was already in the prompt.",1,I immediately felt this was AI-generated when I read the last few sentences. It does not answer the prompt as this is supposed to be from the spouse's point of view.,,1,I feel the father is too accepting of this situation for the severity it entails.,1,I didn't really feel connected to the characters as there wasn't much depth to them.,1,The storyline and dialogue was sort of basic.,1,I didn't really feel moved by this piece.,1,"The character follow tropes, and the conflict is resolved too easily.",5,"Again, this is from the point of view of the daughter, not the father, so it doesn't answer the prompt. Also, the age of the daughter is repeated twice.",,3,"I do think there's truth in being afraid that you won't like what the person you love creates and how you might express that to them. But, I think their mind is changed too easily at the end without even talking to their partner.",2,I feel for the character who has to come to terms with the fact that they do not love something that the person they love has created.,1,"There wasn't really anything I was engaged in. The writing style was very stagnant, and what the prompt was asking was answered too clearly.",1,I wasn't really connected to this story.,2,The character learns in the end that people are complex.,5,"There's a ""lesson to be learned"" aspect at the end of this piece. The conflict is also resolved too easily.",,2,"I think that if someone were truly in an apocalypse, this may be a strategy they would try. But I also think that they would try to go out and find other people instead of solely using the telephone.",2,I am a little empathetic for the character seems so lonely.,1,I wasn't engaged as there wasn't any character or plot point to connect to.,1,I didn't really feel connected to this piece.,1,We do not learn much about the character or world in general aside from what was said in the prompt.,5,"This is not exactly a short story, more like a summary that you would read inside the cover of a book.",,2,I think we would work together to rebel against the robots. But I don't know if we would have such a positive attitude about it.,2,I don't really feel connected enough to the characters. Maybe Lila since she has faced adversity.,2,I think the characters introduction was okay.,1,I didn't really feel connected to the story.,2,They do eventually learn to work with each other. But it feels forced as we don't know how they overcame the differences.,5,"The ""Once upon a time"" indicated to me that this story was written by AI. There isn't much action to the story, mostly background and only the description of action like the rebellion. There's also the ""lesson to be learned"" element.",,4,I think that a human would be convinced or tempted by an angel who promised them peace and serenity.,2,"There's not much to feel empathetic for here I feel, but maybe that I would also be scared and trusting of someone in a new setting.",4,"I liked the detail at the beginning of the story, and the addition of the demon jumping on the person as it was some sort of action that is missing from AI writing.",2,"I felt a little conflicted because if I were in this position, I would probably feel more scared, but also confused like this character is.",2,"I think the main character is a little basic, but the switch from an evil angel and a pure demon is complex.",2,I think the descriptions at the beginning of the piece indicate this to be human writing.,,1,"I don't think depression can be cured that easy, and I wouldn't describe it as ""darkness,"" nor do I think any other person really would.",3,"I feel that this is something many people struggle with. But, the way this story portrays it just kind of brushes depression off.",1,I wasn't really engaged in the story as it didn't feel authentic.,3,"I do feel a little sad for the person experiencing this. But, I also feel a little mad as I don't think their depression can just be cured by having to help their dog.",1,"The only complexity is the role reversal, but this is introduced to us in the prompt. The conflict is resolved too easily.",5,"There's the ""lesson to be learned"" element I've found in AI writing. I also think a human would go with a more darkened storyline rather than just summing it up with a positive ending.",,4,I think the emotions are portrayed in a very human-like way with reactions matching how I would expect them to.,2,I feel empathetic for Rachel who lost everything pretty much.,2,"I feel the storyline was a little basic, but I liked the writing style.",3,I feel a little sad that her life's work was stripped from her by something out of her control.,3,The business man feels bad for his actions. We learn a lot about who Rachel is as well.,3,"I think the first part is very human-like. The descriptions are good. But, again, there's that ""lesson to be learned"" element. Also, the characters are very tropey from what you would expect in this prompt.",,3,"I'm not sure how likely it is a partner would just never read their spouse's book, but it is possible that they might also just not share the same interest.",5,"I feel empathy for the partner who is ignored and lied to. Their partner only cares when their story has to do with them, and they don't find their partner's things interesting for their partner's sake.",1,There's not much action happening. It sort of just answers the prompt.,2,I feel sad for the partner who is being lied to.,1,"The twist is expected, and the characters are tropey in contect of the piece.",5,"The writing piece doesn't answer the prompt as there's not ""nothing like"" the book their partner wrote. Also, there's ""a lesson to be learned"" aspect.",,4,"I do think if in this situation, this is characteristic of how humans would act.",3,I do feel empathetic towards their hesitancy to connect with one another due to loneliness.,1,I feel like it kind of answers the prompt in the most basic way.,2,I felt happy when they were able to find each other. ,1,I think there's not much variance in style or content from what is expected of the prompt.,4,"The emotions portrayed are very basic. It also uses quotes directly from the prompt, but there's also no alteration to them or style.",,2,"I think there's truth in a politician sticking to their morals, but I don't know if other people would strike him down for that, especially since we're not given a situation where this has proved to be a problem for him.",2,I feel empathetic that John is struggling with public hate/backlash.,1,I feel like the ending and storyline are kind of basic.,1,I didn't really feel connected to this story.,2,There's a turn of events that has John end up as the winner. But John is not really complex in his character.,3,"There's not much stylistic variance in the writing. But, I think there's a human-element to the way this is portrayed overall.",,4,Humans would be greatly affected if bestowed this divine power.,1,I don't think there's much to feel empathetic about as the conflict is not really human-based.,4,"I really liked the description of the alien, but I feel the conversation was lackluster.",2,I didn't feel strong emotions while reading this.,5,I think adding in the aspect of the Gods helping the humans was interesting.,1,"There's imagination in the Gods reaching out a helping hand to the humans. There's also background to what the Gods are talking about, but not too much. There's a lot of descriptive factors.",,5,I do think that humans would be opposed to aliens' rule if they were to take over.,4,I do feel for the people put into this situation as it seems their freedoms have been taken from them.,5,I liked the conflict throughout the story and the dialogue was good.,2,I didn't really have an emotional reaction while reading this.,5,"Each character clearly had their own personality traits and goals, and they demonstrated many perspectives.",2,"I'm not sure that the prompt was answered. They are supposed to celebrate the aliens, but this is more of debate.",,5,"I do think if this were true, the neutrality of such a candidate like Jonas would be appealing to a lot of people.",4,I do feel for Jonas who is sort of put in a position where his mediocracy puts him in a position that he might not fully want to be in.,5,I really liked the self-reflection aspect that the piece had.,5,It really makes you reflect on how you fall victim to this as well in our real-life contexts.,5,"There's a lot of complexity not only to Jonas but with the plot as well, delving into human behaviors and thinking.",1,The descriptive and stylistic elements aren't robotic and have a flow.,
