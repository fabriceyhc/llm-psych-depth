11/30/2023 22:44,7,2,"There's some authenticity as the characters are shown to have complex emotions and the relief that comes with realizing you have a second chance to improve yourself. Otherwise, the story is implausible as we do not truly know what happens in the afterlife.",3,"There's empathy when we realize that the characters are given a second chance to improve their shortcomings, but because we don't know much about them, it isn't intense.",1,"This story reminds me of ""The Good Place"" on Netflix, where heaven turns out to be hell, and the main character keeps figuring it out despite the demon's attempt to keep it concealed.  So, the story is not exactly original. There are also not many descriptive factors or interesting punctuation. ",2,"A little happiness is there when it is revealed there's a chance for redemption for both of them, but otherwise, it's hard to connect to the story as we've never been in this situation before.",2,"The characters are kind of cliche as Mark is happy on the outside but more serious on the inside and Susan is described as ""kind."" Then they go on to do what would typically be expected which is to help others realize good qualities about themselves. There is a little complexity to Mark which is not explained: the gossip and lies haunting him.",5,"I feel like the prompt wasn't answered. The demon told them that they were in heaven, but the prompt asked the writer to make a story about them discovering that they were in hell. The names are also very basic as well. ",,3,"There's no magical nose that grants peoples' wishes, but there are people out there who do try to make life better for others. ",2,"There's a little empathy when Jake reveals he has lost his nose, and also in the jealousy Jim has when he sees Jake able to make the children laugh. But otherwise, there's a happy ending to the story, so there's not much evocation. ",2,"The clown nose is interesting in that it can grant wishes in a sully way, but otherwise, there's not really much else to the story. ",2,"Emotion is provoked by the sadness and then happiness you feel when Jake lets Jim try the nose on after he expresses how he feels, but other than that since there's not much else to the characters, not much emotion is provoked.",2,"All the characters seem a little basic. When it's revealed that Jim is jealous of Jake being able to make the kids laugh, we do get to see a little complexity in the characters.",4,"Both the names are basic again and both start with J, which is interesting to me. The ending is also very happy and not much conflict happens throughout the story. ",,4,"Of course the clown's nose isn't real and the events that come from it usually do not happen as well, like the ducks, there are some instances that stay true to our lifetime. Anyone can go viral on the internet now, and there's also boredom associated with working a desk job. ",4,"There's a connection between the reader and Edmund as we see ourselves in his mundane, and with almost everyone, there's been that wish of having people to share laughter and a connection with. ",5,"There's a mystery to how the clown will fulfill his next wish, as it's never what we would expect.",3,"I'd say the story is not exactly emotional, but there's content in seeing Edmund finally able to love himself and to find accomplishment in life.",4,"There's a basicness in Edmund going from grumpy to happy, but how he gets there is complex and unexpected.",1,I do not think that AI would create the hashtag in the middle of the story. I also think that the descriptions of the clown nose and town at the beginning of the story are telling of human-like writing.,,1,"There could be alien life out there; we are not entirely sure, but it's not likely that they would come and invade us. I also don't think it's very likely that we would simply submit to alien demands without waging a war of some sort.",2,"I don't think that there's much to be empathetic about. It might provoke empathy because earth has been invaded and if we were in that situation, it would be scary, but that has never happened so our feelings are not accurate.",2,"I feel like the alien trope of them coming to Earth, invading us, and taking over the government is typical, but the twist of humans submitting was an interesting take.",2,"There's not much to be emotional about as there's not any conflict. There could be a little fear in thinking that us being invaded is a possibility, but that also depends on whether or not the reader believes aliens are real.",2,"The complexity comes from the humans submitting to the aliens, but the aliens themselves are stereotypical. They are described as how we think aliens would look, and they want to invade Earth. The humans break out of the trope of fighting the aliens for Earth, but it's still not a revolutionary idea.",5,The format of the short story is very atypical. The story overall is also very basic in its sentence structure. ,,1,There's not much to the story that would apply to real life. ,2,There's not much to be empathetic about. We can relate to the charm of rediscovering childhood maybe. ,3,"There's a lot of twists and turns in the story with new and fantastical elements, ",1,"There's not much conflict, so there's not much emotion being provoked. ",1,There's not much to the character except for her rediscovering how much she missed the whimsicality of childhood. ,4,"Likely AI. There are elements that indicate human writing like the questions asked, but the writing overall is very basic and lacks style. ",,3,"We do not know if there is a heaven or hell, or what they would look like, but there is truth woven into this perception. We would feel tormented if the entirety of hell was made up of our own remorse and regrets. ",5,"Yes, empathy is provoked. As we all have our own regrets or remorse, we feel for the man who is sentenced to this hell, and it makes us think about what would torment us if we were in that position. ",5,I liked the story. I thought this description of hell was interesting. There was also a lot of descriptive language that got the reader to set the scene in their minds. ,4,"We are provoked to think about our own regrets, and in turn, possibly feel saddened for the character as we know if we were in that position, we would be afflicted as well.",5,"The standard hell trope is evaded as there are no flames or suffering, and the demon even addresses this. We can also see a shift in the main character as he realizes that this ""heaven"" is in reality, hell. ",1,The first paragraph indicated to me that this was written by a human as it was complex and very descriptive. I don't think that these kinds of descriptions could be generated by AI. ,,2,"An alien invasion could happen, but it hasn't, so we don't know how we would act. I do think that it is likely, depending on the situation, that some would be opposed and some would not. ",1,"There's not much empathy as everything turns out okay for the characters in the end. There's also not much conflict besides the disagreement between the resistance and John's feelings, but this is also not really explored. ",1,"Not engaging. The storyline is basic, and there's also not much style going on in terms of the writing. ",2,There's not much emotion provoked as there's not much truth to the story. There's a little happiness when the character is able to make his own choices about life. ,1,"There's not much going on in the story that differs from any standard tropes. There's a resistance, and the main character goes through changes where he has a sudden realization that all along, he just needed to live his life. ",5,"The name John Smith is incredibly basic, and so is the writing style overall. There is not much description of the scene, it is mostly just plot. The commander of the aliens is also introduced with little to no warning. ",,2,"There's not much reality to the story because it's not a long story, so it's scene is not really explored. Also, bees can't talk. But, I do think that a beekeeper would be very kind to his bees. ",1,Not really empathetic because there's not any conflict.,1,"Not much is happening in the story, so it's not very engaging. ",1,There's not much emotion provoked as the story is not fleshed out. ,1,Not complex as we are not able to get to know the characters. We are only told about their relationship through the prompt. ,5,"It's all grammatically correct, but there is no description or real scene set in this piece. ",,4,I do think that a parent would react this way if they discovered their child was putting themselves in extreme danger.,4,There is empathy felt for the parent discovering this secret and having to come to terms with their child putting themselves in danger. ,4,"I think the content is a little basic, but the way the writer sets the scene and gives each subject a personality is interesting. ",3,"I don't think there's too much emotion provoked since I have not felt the weight of being a parent, but I do think for some people, they would be able to relate to this more. ",5,I think there's a solid storyline there and all the characters have motives and feelings. ,1,I think that this was written by a human because emotions are accurately portrayed. It's also a pretty in-depth scene. ,,2,I think there would be more doubt than what is displayed here by Eira. ,3,There's empathy in the fact that she's been burdened by this and her parents made a great sacrifice. ,1,"There's not much action, it's mostly background and a basic storyline. ",1,I didn't really feel any which way while reading this story since the characters are not fleshed out. ,2,"There's a complexity to Eira as we learn about her background and that there's a darkness to her, but that's pretty much it. ",5,The writing does not answer from the parent's point of view like the prompt asked. The writing style is also very basic and the story is mostly background and not fleshed out. ,,2,I'm not sure a beekeeper would act this way. I think they would be surprised and then maybe help the bees instead.,4,"I feel pretty empathetic towards the bees who's whole lives depend on the beekeeper, and then he insults them. ",2,"The cursing at the beginning caught my attention, but other than that, the story wasn't really fleshed out. ",4,I felt pretty surprised at the level of anger the beekeeper had towards these bees. ,2,"Their reaction wasn't really expected, but there's not much else going on in the story. ",2,"I think the cursing is characteristic of humans, so I think a human would write this. ",,1,"There's not much to say about this in terms of authenticity since Gods are not real, or at least we have no notion of them unlike the humans in this story. We are also only really given isight to the Gods' perspectives, not the humans or how they came to kill the God. ",2,There's empathy behind the fact that a God has fallen. ,3,"I think there are some stylistic elements in this story such as the term ""Nevermore"" echoing. But, the way the God is killed is not mentioned and there is only background really. ",5,,2,I think the Gods have some complexity to them. ,5,There are repetitive elements in the story such as many questions in a row asked. There's also not much action going on. ,,1,"I feel there's not authenticity to the plot. Marcus at first realizes that he mistakenly published the wrong book, but then he apologizes to Lily and says that he didn't think about how it would affect her, meaning that he did know about publishing the wrong book???? Contradictory.",2,I felt a little empathetic about him publishing the wrong book. ,1,"It's kind of basic, and the language doesn't show the true anger someone would feel if their partner didn't publish the book they had worked on for so long together. ",1,I didn't really feel engaged by this story. ,1,"I didn't feel that there was any complexity to either character. There was also a very positive resolve, which seemed too calm for the situation.",5,"From the very beginning, when the story was told from a third-person perspective, I thought that it might have been written by AI. It does not answer the prompt and put the reader in a first person perspective. ",,2,"There's authenticity in playing games with friends and escaping to a new world, but that's pretty much it for this story. ",2,"I do feel empathetic as I also enjoy video games and ca understand how playing with a friend would make you feel less lonely--but, the loneliness sometimes returns when you get off the game.",2,"I think the storyline was okay. If I am interpreting the story correctly, I thought it interesting that the NPC was blind and that they became sentient. ",2,I do feel a little sad for the character as they know that they won't ever be able to go into the sunlight.,3,"The character has a downfall and learns to deal with it through video gaming. It's sort of standard that a vampire can't go into the sunlight, but I think the way they're dealing with it demonstrates their complexity to some extent. ",5,"With the conclusion, I don't think a person would try to create or form a message out of a short story for the reader to ""learn from.""",,1,"I'm not sure that there's enough surprise or horror in the human's reaction to feeling a strange hand grip their's, they mostly just seem creeped out. ",1,There's not really anything to feel empathetic about in this scene personally. ,1,"Overall, the style and scene is very cliche and does not engage me.",1,I do not really feel much emotion when reading this piece.,1,"There's not a lot of complexity. All the descriptions, especially in the first paragraph, are very basic, and I have seen them before, especially the heart-racing one. ",5,The cliche descriptions at the beginning of the piece indicated to me that this was AI writing. ,,2,"I feel like there authenticity in the lesson towards the end as it's not entirely wrong, it's just out of place for the story.",2,"There's some empathy to be had for the person in this situation as they probably feel scared in this unknown situation, and I would be too if I saw a demon. ",1, I feel like the storyline was predictable and the dialogue was also pretty standard. I wasn't really engaged because I could sense the twist coming. ,1,I wasn't really moved by this piece. ,2,I think there's something to be said for the way the twist was revealed and the inclusion of the deceitful cherub but an honest demon. ,5,"Once upon a time, it immediately indicated to me that this was written by AI. Again, it is also very obvious about the message of the story in the conclusion of the piece. ",,5,"I do think there is a possibility for this to happen in the future, and we indeed have seen the consequences of political members trying to get ahead by using deception and manipulation. ",2,"I don't really feel any empathy for any of the characters as Jameson is revealed to be evil, and there any other characters except the masses. I do feel empathetic in a sense that this could possibly happen to us one day. ",1,"I don't really feel engaged with this story as it sets up Jameson to be deceitful, very obviously. There's also not a lot of first-person action going on, mostly just storytelling. ",2,I do feel a little fearful that this could happen to us one day. ,1,"There's not really a complex motive behind Jameson's actions, it's just that he wants to move ahead and earn power. ",5,"Once I saw the name Jameson Smith, I had a feeling this was AI written. There seems to be a pattern with texts that I believe to be AI and the introduction of a character by their first and last name. I also think the mention of AI in this story is quite unusual, and I don't know if a person's first thought would be to go for that idea. ",,1,I don't know if a parent would act this calmly or unemotionally to discover their daughter was a Moon Princess. I would expect there to be some grief or passionate anger about why their daughter was chosen. ,1,"I don't feel emotionally connected to these characters since they don't seem to display emotions themselves, so I don't really feel any grief. ",1,"It answers the prompt in the way that is expected, so it's not engaging at all. ",1,"Again, no emotional connection.",1,"The characters are cliche, and the resolve is too positive for the situation at hand. ",5,"I had a feeling from the beginning that this was AI generated. The elements of the story are very basic, and it answers the prompt in the way that you would expect this prompt to be answered; there's no imagination. There's also no emotion to the characters, their answers are not aligning with the severity of the situation. ",,3,"I think if bees could talk and had the responsibility of rent, this may be a plausible situation for them. I do think that they would work together as bees are usually a communal species. ",3,"I feel a little empathetic since the bees seem to be struggling with rent, and so many humans are in that position as well. ",3,"I think the story is a cute one, and it's fun to read all the bee-related names. But it's not exactly complex in narrative nor does it have any really emotional value to it. ",2,I don't really feel any big emotions while reading this piece. Maybe just a little content that they were able to find a solution. ,1,"I think the ending is very cliche in its positive nature. And Dronator fulfills the trop of being the old, wise bee. ",2,"I think the differences in speech (such as ""ye"") indicate that a human most likely wrote this. But, it does have the AI characteristic of a blatant lesson at the end of the story of the generations learning to work together. ",,5,"I think that this is an entirely plausible event. Although we may not all be authors, there are aspects of people that we have yet to discover, or we undermine, and these are through-and-through human faults and feelings. ",4,"I feel empathetic because I too have also come to discover things about friends or family that I never would have thought characterized them, and have come to love them more because of it. ",4,"I think that the story sets itself to have a predictable ending, but I liked the descriptive language throughout. ",3,"I didn't really feel emotional on any sort of intense level as the story itself was not an intense one in terms of content. I did, however, feel happy for the couple at the end as they learned to see each other in a new light. ",5,We see another side to the character's wife even though we are looking at her from a first-person perspective. I think this is a complex writing technique. We also see the main character learn to grow and accept new parts of his wife. ,1,"There is an error in punctuation in the second to last paragraph, and I find that indicative of human writing. There's also a different flow to this text, one that uses longer sentences and more descriptive words. ",
