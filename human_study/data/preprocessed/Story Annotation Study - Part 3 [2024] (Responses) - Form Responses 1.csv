Additionally, it cost hundreds of dollars to pay for medical care. Thus, the humans were filled with joy from having all of their needs met by the aliens for only working 16 hours a week. The real world is usually much more cutthroat but the aliens don't know that. So I think that the story was likely written by a human because of the connection to the real world and the humans thinking there is a catch.
