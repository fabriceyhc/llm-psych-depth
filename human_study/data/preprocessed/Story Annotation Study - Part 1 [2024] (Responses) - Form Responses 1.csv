3/30/2024 16:30:40,15,2,This story sounded very absurd so it leads me to believe that a human did not write this.,3,I felt a little bad for the demon under Tyler's bed because Tyler was saying inappropriate things.,3,,3,,2,The characters didn't seem to have much depth to them and Tyler was a basic character who remembers his father's words.,2,,,5,The story sequence logically follows and details parallels with the real world.,4,,5,"As I read the story, I wanted to learn more and keep reading. I enjoyed the plot and it sounds very similar to plotlines I've read in books and seen in media. ",4,,4,There is enough character development for John but I would have liked more backstory for XJ9.,5,"The story is very comparable to that of works by humans regarding robots and less affluent individuals feeling like slaves. The idea of robots having sentience is of great interest to humans so it has been portrayed in the media through many forms. Thus, I am inclined to believe a human wrote this due to that history.",,4,,5,,5,,4,,4,,4,,I like the use of Cerberus as a therapeutic figure for the lost soul.

3/30/2024 23:48:33,10,2,"The unrealistic scenario does not change the unrealistic behavior showcased by Tyler. As much as I would want to score it one, it reads as a comedy and I'm not sure it intended to come off as realistic or 'authentic'. ",1,There was no sense of danger felt by the protagonist. It was hard to relate to a protagonist that felt completely confident in such a scenario. ,5,The story had captivating and creative twists from the prompt. ,4,It read as a comedy and made me smile. ,2,"It may be a matter of style, as many human works are simplistic in nature. However, in terms of depth of characters/relationships, there was little objectively speaking. ",2,"I have never used Chat GPT. I do not know how to compare or distinguish between a human and not. I'm assuming it's decently good, but prone to mistakes. The reason I put a two despite being lenient on the simplistic nature and the liberties taken beyond the given prompt is because of nonsensical mistakes. For instance, the humor seemed very human, but when the word ""dude"" was considered a pet name, it showcased a lack of understanding of such terms. ",,1,"The emotional buildup was not only underwhelming, but also, not emphasized nearly enough. The relationship between Xj9 and John Smith was not written in a way that made John's anger justified. ",1,The relationship between Xj9 and John Smith was not written in a way that made John's anger justified. More telling than showing. ,1,The story was just describing a rebellion without any kind of depth or complexity. ,1,I did not care. ,1,"From the names to the catalyst for the rebellion, everything was basic and dryly written. ",1,No depth. No complexity. Too simple and no emotional progression. ,,2,I couldn't really follow how the soul began to feel at peace because of the dog's presence. Should have elaborated more.,1,I couldn't really follow how the soul began to feel at peace because of the dog's presence. Should have elaborated more. I could also not feel the weight of their death's tragedy. ,1,It was literally the prompt in slightly more detail. ,1,,2,"It describes the scene with detail in some areas, but just resorts to telling/explaining the emotions instead of showing their progression. ",3,"The story adheres closely to the prompt. It takes no real creative liberties. It is also very unspecific at times, saying the soul died tragically, but refusing to elaborate or explain the emotions associated with that end beyond 'anger'. Yet, because certain phrases and analogies used give me a sense of complex understanding, and because it reminds me of a way someone I know writes, I can't confidently say it is LLM. ",,4,I understand to some degree what it could feel like to realize you don't really know someone you thought you did. It is a problem I could see someone having. ,3,"I personally don't think it did a great job of emphasizing the inner turmoil Lucas might feel, but there is an attempt. ",3,"It wasn't the most engaging, but not the most boring either. ",2,The emotions were not emphasized well. ,3,There are moments where the writing insinuates more depth. There is an inner conflict despite it not being as well written as it could (in my opinion). ,4,,,3,People are curious and often end up doing things they are told not to do. ,3,,3,A bit boring. ,3,"While I do think some emotions could have been illustrated more clearly, there was an attempt. ",3,,3,,,1,The people act way to carelessly with what they know is a potentially dangerous object. Strange dialogue. ,2,"The story reads like a comedy and made me laugh, but I did not resonate with the problem itself",4,"It was an interesting concept, and the comedy used unconventional language that sounds like something I'd hear from someone in real life. ",3,"Some of the more human reactions aren't present, but I don't think the purpose was to make me pity the loss of the protagonist's girlfriend anyway. It seems like it is trying more to evoke laughter. ",2,It is not complex and the characters don't have much depth. ,5,The language has a lot of human-sounding phrases. The grammar mistakes also make it seem more human. ,,4,"How the alien compares dreams to foods, the emotions in these kinds of analogies felt human. ",4,I really enjoyed the comparisons and the language used.,5,I really enjoyed the comparisons and the language used. A lot of questions are raised. ,4,I understood the weight nightmares and dreams in general carry. ,4,"Despite being short and relatively simple, the story managed to highlight the sorrows and terror that comes with being human. The alien showing pity shows a humane side, too. ",5,,,3,"There was some emotions portrayed realistically. The feeling of absence for someone who you thought should be there (in the beginning) was great, but as the work progressed, the story became rushed. ",3,The beginning felt the most human. ,3,The story was initially engaging when the story was not rushed. ,3,I understand why it would be hard to have an absent parental figure. ,3,It needs to go into more detail as to the desire to the father. ,5,The writing style was inconsistent.

4/3/2024 18:36:36,8,5,"At first I was going to give it a 4 because of the confusing ambiguity of the being, but then I decided that this ambiguity fed into the craziness the author was trying to convey. ",4,I feel like I understand the narrator's craziness to a greater degree through the imagery or rather nonimagery of the being,5,,4,the sexuality and the possibility of it being rape or some strange beastiality ; it was also funny though ,5,I've never seen psychopathy or craziness represented in such a way --- I would say this story is innovative ,5,Only a human would take a prompt and twist it in such an imaginative way ,,1,,1,,1,,1,,2,It has structure and a sense of completion but the completion is not in any way fulfilling or interesting,1,everything is so macroscopic and abstract and written like a recipe ,,1,,1,,2,has somewhat interesting descriptions at parts ,1,,1,,1,,,3,"Although I feel immediately that this is AI written, I felt that this story was written better than the other AI stories (the stories I judge to be AI). It seemed that the narration of the main character did indeed have an expectation and a disappointment that I could feel.
