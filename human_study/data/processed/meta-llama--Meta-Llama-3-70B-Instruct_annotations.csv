Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings.  Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask.  I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.  

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation.  I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like.  A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for.  The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right.  Something was missing.  That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense.  There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand.  It was truly a marvel of technology.  Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny.  Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries.  A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface.  His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did.  I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight.  And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well.  A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...",219,Obtuse_Mongoose,2023-02-17 20:57:55

They were both vampires and more importantly, best friends going back nearly 300 years now. It wasn't unusual for one to not hear from the other but it had been weeks now without his friend answering his letters. Normally they wrote one another every few days. It was unusual to say the least.

Elric feared the worst and tred cautiously in the night. Razmat was not always the most careful and hunters were always coming up with new ways to track their kind. He first checked the mailbox. It was overflowing with junk mail and his letters. Not good. Not good at all. He peered into one window and then the next. No signs of Razmat still. He briefly decided leaving, but Razmat had risked his life for him too many times. If this was a trap, Elric would just have to kill the wretched hunters who had stolen his friend from him.

Elric steeled his nerves and then procured the spare key Razmat has always kept hidden under the dirty red and white garden gnome closest to the door. He made a note to chastise his friend again on the pathetic hiding spot should he seem him once more.

With a careful twist of a key and knob he stepped inside. He could feel the adrenaline spiking in him. His whole body tensed. Ready to flee or fight he called out in a hushed voice, ""Razmat!"" Nothing. ""Razmat, you old fool!"" Nothing. Then he heard it. A soft cry or perhaps deathrattle.. ""Ahhhhhhhh.."" It was Razmat. He was still alive. The sound had come from the library located just behind the door atop the stairs. 

Elric would not give the hunters a chance to hear him or finish the job if there was still time. He barred his fangs, and with great vampiric strength and speed exploded through the door. Razmat was seemingly alone and lying on the floor under some kind of heat lamp and a device on his head with two devices strapped to his wrists. Clearly some kind of torture or magic from the hunters. ""NO! Razmat! Speak to me! Who did this to you?!"" 

Razmat yelped in surprise and took off his VR headset, ""Wha? Elric? What are you- What happened to my door?!"" Elric's face sped through half a dozen emotions. Grief. Fear. Confusion. Relief. Happiness. Embarassment. ""I.. I thought you were in danger. You stopped writing. Your mailbox was full. You were on the ground... What is this device that has snared you?""

""Ohhhh, yes, yes! I'm sorry dear Elric."" Razmat chuckled and looked guilty. ""I guess I have been getting carried away. I had my familiar introduce me to this new gadget called ""Vee Arrr""! It's amazing! Elric, you'll never believe it! Please you must try it!"" Elric eyed his friend warily and took a half-step back, ""If this is a trap Razmat.. Blink twice. I will not rest until I free you."" Razmat just gave his friend a stern look, one a father might give a child trying to get out of trouble with a ridiculous story. Razmat reached out his hand offering the headset to his friend. ""Elric, please. This isn't a trap. It's fun! Put this on.""

Elric sighed and cautiously examined the device. ""Vee Arrr"".. He had heard the term once or twice, he was fairly sure. Neither were known to keep up with the recent trends as some of the younger vampires. ""Okay, Razmat. For you."" With a deep breath he fastened the headset to his head and opened his eyes. Immediate regret. ""GHAST! TREACHERY! LIES! RAZMAT YOU'VE BETRAYED ME! NO! AHHHH!"" He pulled his cloak over his body and then.. Laughter? Razmat was laughing? Wait. He wasn't burning. ""What is this magic?"" Elric stammered. ""This is what I wanted to show you! Vee Arrr! We can live in the daylight again, friend! Through these devices! It's amazing! What sights there are to see! It's all I've done since we last spoke!"" Elric examined the sunlight around him. It looked so much like it did all those hundreds of years ago. He took off the headset and began to weep. ""I know, friend. I know. You get used to it. Slowly."" Razmat began to point at the heat lamps ""Look here, I even have heat lamps to give the sun warmth! It's the full experience! Dry your tears and lie on this mat here."" Elric smiled softly, ""very well."" and put back on the headset. It was a virtual world simulating a nice beach on a sunny day. Elric rested on the mat which was perfectly positioned to be on a beach chair and felt the ""sun"" bask his skin. ""Ahhhhhhh.."" Elric slowly exhaled in a state of bliss. ""You must show me how to get one of these for myself.""",403,DoomGloomAngst,2023-02-17 19:29:09

Admittedly he had the misfortune to fail at both, as given what he now was death would not be an untimely occurrence and he’d have to perish purposefully if he saw fit to do so. 

Still, it was always something to see when society pushed the envelope and created something never before seen, and entertainment had been no less magnificent. Gerry liked simple pleasures when he could find them. Petting the occasional stray cat that wandered onto his property at night was the liveliest of happenings, as he tended to keep away from the small town nearby. It made him feel closer to the earth to allow the forest around his modest cabin to provide sanctuary.

When years become decades and decades become centuries one tends to lose patience for trends and routine becomes a boon. The flow of life blurs together into a fog that always seems more or less the same no matter what changes are witnessed. Films and television had been an interesting development as the entertainment certainly provided a way to pass the time at the very least. Holed up far and away from most civilization Gerry had put off electricity for the longest time until he realized the artificial light could feel warm if the voltage was high enough. It wasn’t a sunrise, but it was something. 

It was easy to miss the warmth and the light if he was being honest; as he had been a farmer's boy something young. The feel of cold damp earth in his hands under the warmth of the sun was nothing but imagination now, and he had long since lost the memory of how pink the sky could be at sunrise. Fires in his wood stove were nice, but the light still wasn’t right. It wouldn’t brighten up the sky and sunbeams wouldn’t shine through the trees at dawn in his cabin, but it was alright. 

Digital media was eventually added to Gerry’s long list of hobbies, though remained near the bottom as simply watching events play out was already a very long tried and true pastime. More engaging activities always caught his interest and held it, and the creation of video games had initially intrigued him simply because it required direct input. 

The initial release of small puzzles created with pixels of light from electricity on a glass screen had been fun enough to follow, so he did for a little while. Every year that passed saw improvements to these generated images, though the advent of color television temporarily distracted him from generated shapes in games, as movies once again took a spotlight.

The sun in those films was always wrong though, always... off in some way. The studio lighting casting improper shadows and unrealistic flatness, paling in comparison to the real thing. It seemed a lost hope that anyone would ever be able to capture a real and proper recreation of the sun. Gerry still kept a small ember of hope smoldering deep in his core that provided comfort on days when he found the world felt a little colder.

It was years later that he cycled through a few hobbies he liked to fall back on when he decided to bite the metaphorical bullet and invest in new technology for his small homestead. The faithful color television had finally crackled a final hum and failed to display a picture. The tiny screen remained a glossy dark mirror that showed nothing but an empty room in the dim glow of the fire. 

Blessedly, it was the dead of winter. Days were brief while nights remained long and the sun dipped below the horizon well before evening properly set in. Heading into town was not ideal, but online shopping never appealed much to Gerry. It was due to the fact that he was genuinely quite old fashioned and still preferred to physically see what he would be acquiring before purchase. 

Admittedly he had been eyeing new televisions for quite some time, though age had tempered his impulses to general practicality at best and desperate longing for old familiarity at worst. Gerry maintained an awareness of technological advances as it would do him no benefit to remain ignorant, but remained skeptical that fifteen years could really make much of a difference. 

Fifteen years had apparently made quite a lot of difference, both in quality and in possibilities to explore. He found himself asking the young man at the counter what all he would need to play this new game with a beautiful sunrise depicted on the back of the case. Gerry left with a shard of hope lodged deep in his chest and a purchase that funded the business owners for the next month.

It ached as he set everything up, the cold metal and wires feeling like they held anything but life in them. He was an old man in the body of someone who had never known age and never would. The cold darkness of mountains and forest all he had known for so long it was all he thought he *wanted* to know.

The light from the screen occupying his living room had been practically blinding when he turned it on, stark white and bright logos disorienting and crisp. It was too sterile and had no depth of color, and it was not a sun but a flare. Still cold and unyielding in its intensity of artificial brightness.

Gerry picked up the controller and was almost hesitant to see what might be waiting for him. The warmth from his fire was smoldering, a hearty blaze reduced to soft crackling and a muted glow. 

Making his digital approximation of self on the screen he dove into the artificial world with an eagerness that could only be described as raw and unburdened. He was someone else on the screen, and it looked *amazing*. So caught up with how people and surfaces were displayed in front of him he almost forgot why he had made the purchase to begin with. Until he saw it. 

There, in a false sky inside a screen of light inside his cabin, was the sun. Rays of dawn were cresting over a mountain top reflecting off the blinding snow and painting the landscape with glorious warmth. This was a world he could enjoy in the light of day. 

If he closed his eyes as the pinks and oranges of the sky lit up his room the warmth of the fire felt akin to sunlight for the first time in centuries, and it was magnificent.",45,Gallifrey63,2023-02-17 22:59:19

The noise sounded like a sigh, mixed with a hiss, yet it was somehow happy at the same time. He stood in his open doorway looking down at the ground, where laid an Amazon delivery. 
Velstat's eyes widened as he studied the small plastic bag. He gazed upon this plastic bag with the same look he gave his prey. This delivery was as equally intriguing. It had arrived a full night early.
 ""How fantastic"" he thought. 

For a moment he was looking, studying the minute details and curves of the bag and its smooth white plastic coating. As it reflected off the dull light above, he was reminded that soon he would know the Sun again. At least, he would know it in higher 3D graphical fidelity than any 3D media before. And the next moment, within an instant, he was  holding the plastic package tight against his chest, his door already closed. 

He slit open the plastic bag with his nail and into his palm fell the new Blood Drinker game. Blood Drinker 3: The Viking.

 Velstat was expressionless as he slid the game into his Xbox 9000. Not only was this game using the newest Puretime rendering software, but it also ran on Matrix-Net Tracing. Truly nothing else could render a normal day as good as this game would. It might even look prettier than the real day. A wicked smile crept across his face at the thought. Ah yes soon he would be playing it. Relishing in the Suns bright touch. Nearly day-dreaming, he thought of how he would soon be moving his character throughout the world, through the day while looking up on the most beautiful Sun ever created. And soon he could look upon this beautiful sun.

 Velstat sat on his couch with the posture of a marble statue. As he picked up his controller Velstat let out a small stifled laugh, which turned into a full on below. He was laughing at God. Velstat had no care for the Sun. He didn't really miss it, in fact he hated it. But this was about beating God at his own twisted game. Velstat would win this battle. 
A small victory in this damnation he thought. 
""Yes...""Looking up towards his ceiling,  ""For about 8 fun hours I will soak up as much Sun as I can. And there is nothing You can do to stop it!"" He snarled the last part out loud, pointing his finger up at the ceiling, towards God.

Velstat had other reasons to play, besides pulling a cheeky one on God of course. He was a fan of the first two Blood Drinker games, but this one would be special. He was very old, so old he didn't remember most of his past. But he remembered enough. He was at one time a Viking. He knew Blood Drinker 3: The Viking was not going to be historically accurate but it seemed fitting that in this show of rebellion against the Almighty,  that the main character  should also be a Viking. Velstat finished off his glass of very Red Wine and pressed play.

The graphics were awing. Even his Vampire eyes were completely stunned at the realism. In game, he moved his character through a forest and he could see as the Sun peaked between the trees. Velstat stepped into the open field, soaking in the beautiful day, marveling at the brightness. When suddenly in real life, he burst into flames.",15,LightBlindsAtFirst,2023-02-18 01:04:54

The color in the sky was getting brighter. Victoria grinned widely as she peered at the screen. It was a ritual she performed in games like this, anticipating the sunrise and then stopping to watch it. A wistful sigh escaped her ancient, youthful lips. It took her back hundreds of years to the last time she watched the dawn. A dawn she took for granted and never realized it would be her last.

""Vikkie!"" A familiar voice called from another room, startling Victoria out of her reverie.

Victoria paused the game and set down her Switch to approach her bedroom door. ""I'm in my room.""

Footsteps. Familiar ones. Anne! ""Cover up, the sun is still getting through some of the windows."" Anne said.

Mindful of how the Sunlight might enter her room she backed away and picked up her robe, wrapping it around her and pulling the hood over her head. The door opened and closed quickly--just enough to let Anne through.

""Okay, it's safe, Vikkie."" Anne said.

Victoria pulled back her hood and looked for Anne. The woman stood a few paces into the room from the door. Following the modern, comfortable fashion, Anne wore a gray hoodie and form fitting jeans. It was distasteful to Victoria--she preferred the elaborate fashions from her time. Fashions that hid more of the shape of the body, but she was working on that.

""Greetings, Anne."" Victoria said, approaching the woman with arms open. Then she noticed the box between them--keeping them from their usual greeting embrace. ""What's this?""

""Hi, Vikkie."" Anne looked down, directed by Victoria's words. ""Oh, it's a present.""

""A present?"" Victoria echoed quizzically.

""Mmhmm! For Valentines!""

""You know I can't have chocolate...""

""It's not chocolate.""

Victoria narrowed her eyes at the package before taking it in her hands and moving to her desk to begin opening the brown box. ""You should have wrapped it."" Victoria noted blankly.

""I thought you said wrapping paper was quaint and unnecessary. 'It serves no purpose.'""

Having removed the tape and started opening the flaps, she looked up at Anne with a steely gaze. ""Well, maybe I just like it. It's pretty.""

Anne giggled and drew closer, draping her arms around Victoria's neck and shoulders and kissed the top of her head. ""I'm sorry. I'll use 'frivolous decoration' next time.""

Victoria shook her head while she removed her gift from a variety of boxes out of the brown box. When it sat on her desk there was what looked to be a dark brick with straps to hold it on the head and wands with rings at the ends.

""What is it?"" Victoria asked, uncertain how to express herself with regard to the odd gift.

""It's a VR headset."" She said, reaching past Victoria to grab the wands. ""And these are the controllers. I told you about VR.""

Victoria raised her brows and pursed her lips. ""The simulated reality device?"" She asked cautiously.

Anne nodded. ""That's right. I know you've been wanting to experience watching the sunrise again... I know watching it as Link isn't enough.""

""Anne..."" Victoria pressed her brows together in a grateful expression and drew Anne's face down with one hand to press a kiss against her cheek. ""Thank you. But... I don't want to experience this without you either.""

""You won't have to, Vikkie."" Anne assured her. She stepped back and slipped her backpack from her shoulders. ""I have my own."" She said as she set her carry storage for her own headset and controllers on the desk. ""I'll be with you.""

They took the time to set up the devices and get into the headsets. They moved into a private VR world together.

""It's..."" Victoria trailed off, astounded by how similar this world was to the world she knew.

""Surprisingly realistic?"" Anne giggled. ""I know. The weirdest parts are the floating menus, aren't they.""

Victoria nodded.

""Are you ready?"" Anne asked, moving close. Blindly, she dropped her controller and took Victoria's hand, interlocking their fingers.

""I'm not sure...""

Taking it as a yes, Anne pointed her controller and clicked the button to initiate the gradual sunrise. Then she dropped the other controller and held onto Victoria. ""I'm right here. You're safe. I'm excited to see this with you.""

A soft croaking noise came from Victoria's throat. Her golden eyes slowly widened as she saw the rays of the simulated sun reaching over the horizon. Though she didn't need to breathe, she often did and now--now she held her breath. It felt like something powerful enveloped her ancient heart and like a wonderful knot of joy was being pulled up through her. As the light of that golden sphere hit her eyes she started to feel warm tears welling up in her eyes. The crimson tears streamed down her cheeks. Overwhelmed with emotion she instinctively sought out Anne's presence and squeezed her hand.

""I'm here. It's beautiful isn't it?"" Anne said softly, squeezing Victoria tightly.

Victoria nodded and sniffled wetly. ""Anne...""

""Yes, Vikkie?""

""Thank you..."" She croaked.

""You're welcome."" Anne replied. ""I love to see your joy.""

""I love you, Anne....""

""I love you too, Victoria.""",24,_SapphicVixen_,2023-02-17 23:08:02

A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter. 

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived. 

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",7,MarshallSorrows,2023-02-18 01:16:10

Sickness and despair, families torn apart, entire economies in shambles. 

A new source of sustenance we were told.  An inexhaustible supply of the richest dreams ever found.  Most sentient species dreamed infrequently and only then short periods. They had evolved from sleep to hibernation where dreams do not exist.  Eons of space flight across galaxies and the time required to get there had forced an evolutionary change on almost all species. 
A few species still existed for us to harvest from but these were simple,  joyless and bland. They brought little satisfaction apart from keeping the pangs of hunger at bay. 

Then I found it. Earth as it is called. 

Billions of sentient beings. Each one with unique dreams as varied as the number of stars. Our process for harvesting was painless and left no trace. And, far as we had determined,  it had no ill effects on the humans.  They had an inexhaustible supply of dreams.  We could sustain our entire populace on less than 10% of this planet.  

Early samples were promising.  So much so that I skipped testing for side effects.  In a thousand millennia we had only ever come across a handful of harmful effects and even then,  it was only when we harvested from a source caught in the event horizon of a black hole. Thier spaghettified minds being torn apart in that unending moment made a few of our species go mad. 

So I harvested dream upon dream. 
I had tried to find dense population centers to harvest for expediency. I only occasionally fed as needed. Two or 3 dreams would be more than enough for my journey home. A child's dream of a sunlit field, birds singing and their pet dog running beside them. It was delightful. 

A young adult male was playing his favorite sport at the highest levels with great success. This one filled me up so much so that I skipped 3 cycles before my next one. 

I think they are called veterans.  
The realization that this human was reliving actual moments they had experienced was unlike anything I had ever tasted.  The fear, self loathing at failing to save a comrade, the unbridled hatred but most of all the sadness.  It was horrible and exhilarating at the same time. I hated myself for it but couldn't stop. It consumed every fiber of my being  I could not live without more of it.  It didn't offer any nourishment or benefit but I could think of nothing else.  I knew I was wasting away,  ignoring basic needs to consume more and more of these nightmares as they were called but I couldn't stop. 

When I arrived at my home world I was near death.  Unconscious,  I was taken to our healing center.  In the meantime my stores of dreams were unloaded and distributed.  I was unable to warn them. 
When the dreams I harvested from what the humans called a VA hospital, were consumed, a riot ensued.  We had never known violence against one another but the need to get more of these dreams was so strong that all reason was abandoned.  It was determined that mature human dreams should not be consumed. 


Not wanting a repeat of the riots the next batch, from young humans was released. From what humans called an orphanage.

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and *bloody*.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, *ever*, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a *nightmare* tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",1203,SirPiecemaker,2022-09-06 09:13:46

Watching as the human laid trapped in a spider’s web, unable to move. Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

 

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldn’t eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes in it.

 

As the spider revealed itself, the human only grew more panicked, making small mumbles in their sleep as they tossed and turned until finally Xai relieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the human’s ears, slowly drifting into Xai’s skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

 

Even after being fed, Xai couldn’t leave the human’s side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mind’s way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

 

Xai took another look into the human’s mind, finding this dream far more realistic. The dream consisting of the human sitting beside a family member, discussing something that appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect example of a brain making sense of things that had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from?
The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alien’s mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

 

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didn’t know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind. Xai hovered above the bed before vanishing in a blink of light, returning to their ship.",330,sadnesslaughs,2022-09-06 08:45:39

“These humans do not just have dreams. They have these horrible, twisted dreams called nightmares, where everything is terrible. I’m returning home.”

The Hexalians anxiously awaited Kashitok, expecting to see a shaken and defeated comrade. When he first appeared, their fears seemed true. His face, once healthily green, approached a brownish colour that would lead many Hexalians to shake their head and mournfully prepare a permanent send-off into the darkness of space.

What was strange, however, was the radiant smile on Kashitok.

“You look positively psychotic,” mission commander Laxok said. “Your expression and your complexion do not match.”

“I know, sir,” Kashitok said. “I think I need a lie down, and a long time in a proper toilet. But I’ll give my report soon.”

After a Hexalian hour of the entire space base trying to ignore the sounds coming from the washroom, Kashitok finally emerged with a much healthier colour.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “I understand if you need more rest due to the harrowing experience.”

“Oh, I actually feel quite good,” Kashitok said. “Refreshed, even.”

“If you say so,” Laxok sighed. “You did well, emissary.”

“Those nightmares,” Kashitok felt his tongue instinctively rub across his lips. “They are strange. It kind of burns your tongue.And your face. Maybe you get a headache.”

“That sounds utterly horrifying,” Laxok said gravely. “I’m so sorry. I’ll henceforth strike off Earth as a potential hunting ground.”

Kashitok held out a hand, shaking his head.

“No, no, no, don’t be. I shouldn’t like it... but I do.”

“What do you mean, you like it?”

The emissary rubbed his chin, gently clicking his tongue.

“Dreams taste... good. They linger on your tongue, makes you happy, and leaves you contented. But...”

Laxok leaned in closer, curiosity turning his face a shade of purple.

“But?”

“Eating a nightmare is challenging,” Kashitok said, smiling manically. “It’s painful, but that’s also what gives it flavour. And that makes me want to eat it more.”

“... You are a sick bastard, Kashitok.”

“I brought a sample back,” the emissary said, putting a small transparent bottle in front of his commander. It was a shifting mess of dark crimson, with streaks of grey and black mingling uglily within it. It shook on the table, like the nightmare was trying desperately to claw its way out.

“That looks disgusting,” Laxok made a face.

“Just a small sip, commander.”

Laxok tentatively reached out, grasping the bottle firmly. He uncapped it, and watched as the nightmare almost desperately reached out into the open air. With his lips towards the mouth of the bottle, he gently tasted the nightmare.

Laxok jumped up immediately, breaking out into an impromptu dance. He slammed the bottle onto the table—which Kashitok immediately capped—and rushed towards a more pleasant dream in his collection. One desperate gulp after gulp, the commander finally calmed down enough to take back his seat.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “You are insane.”

“Maybe,” Kashitok said, putting the nightmare fully into his mouth. “But I’m doing the human a favour. They are welcome.”

The gaseous creature travelled from planet to planet gathering the essences of insanity and fantasy from wandering minds of unconscious sentient creatures; their dreams. They floated just above their heads like soft white clouds as absorb the sweet essence from their host.  
But this one, this planet. It was different. It was wrong, so very very wrong.  
When the Greycloud found it’s latest host on a small planet in untravelled space, they saw that the creature was moving it’s head slightly, like he was twitching ever so faintly.  
No, not twitching. It was... squirming. Twisting. It’s breathing was laboured should’ve brought the thought that, had this being not been confined to sleep, it would have been writhing in agony... and fear.  
But, the Greycloud ignored its own subconscious observations. The warning signs were all there, but they all went unheeded. It had always been a glutton, and a fool.  
The Greycloud place itself upon the creatures head, hungry for a meal. It took it’s first taste, dipping it’s own consciousness slowly into the sea that was a sentient being’s mind. One shallow take, it noticed that the dream tasted odd. But it’s helium stomach urged stronger than its logic. It dipped deeper, the dream tasted sour, but it thought that this must be the outside, there must be a sweet center. It dove even deeper, and deeper, and deeper. The dream tasted even sourer and sourer, until finally the Greycloud’s consciousness reached the center core of the slumbering creature’s dream. It opened it’s stomach, and sucked in everything it could. A mistake, a horrible mistake.  
Lighting, hail, and blood rain pulsed through it’s gaseous form as it arched and twisted into unnatural and horrid shapes. As it squirmed in agony.  
Pain and fear burned through the Greycloud’s consciousness. They mixed with pain and fear that was not the Greyclouds own but that of the slumbering creature.  
Visions flooded its mind, but unlike other foragings, these visions were not sweet, were not soft. They were sour, spoilt, and rotting. The unholy taste would have brought out ear piercing screams from the Greycloud had it possess a mouth to scream from and lungs to gasp with.  
But the Greycloud had sent its own consciousness too deep into the slumbering creature’s dream. It could not pull itself out, and for 5 agonizing hours the Greycloud suffered, and when the creature finally awoke, the Greycloud did not even rejoiced, for it had not the energy to do so. It slithered away, back into the cosmos, scarred and squirming with fear.",83,The_Portal_Passer,2022-09-06 12:18:44

Freshly asleep, its denizens knew not of the being from the cosmos sent to feast on their nightly visions.

It crept onto a rooftop, peering into a window of one of the freshly asleep, shifting in bed, eyes darting around under their closed lids. A perfect meal, the being thought to itself, and as such it crept into the victim’s mind, eager to get its fill. 

It soon found itself in a busy city street, moving in a crowd of blurred faces. It sees the victim sitting alone, looking down on the ground as if they were unaware of the being’s presence. Perfect, It thought, as it began its consumption. The distant cityscapes of the dream soon began to crumble, much to the apathy of the dream’s constructs, and the victim themselves.

When the destruction drew near the being, the dream’s blurred constructs all stop in their tracks, beginning to eye the victim in hostile contempt. The visible destruction was soon flooded with a blackened fog, much to the being’s confusion. It wasn’t causing this fog?...

As the rest of their surroundings sink into the darkness, all that is left in front of the being is the crowd and the victim on their lonesome, sobbing on their bench. Sobbing? Dreamers usually never act like that, the being thought. It soon found itself startled by a sudden noise, yelling, coming from the crowd of constructs.

The sounds stank of vitriol. Of hatred. Of fear. The being knew not what those meant in this environment, it just meant to simply consume this dream. Yet it wasn’t budging anymore. The dream wasn’t collapsing, the being wasn’t getting fuller, for it wasn’t a dream anymore. 

It was a nightmare.

The constructs slowly vanish one by one, leaving just the being and the victim, the latter of which continues crying, surrounded by a pitch black void of nothingness. The being, confused, thought its job was done, yet it could not leave. It was trapped in this person’s mind. 

It started becoming desperate, clawing at the dark despite nothing being there. The victim, who has gathered enough of themselves to look up, sees the being in its full form, standing in front of them amidst nothing else. 

Then they screamed. In terror? In rage? It couldn’t tell, but the simply the sensation of such during what’s supposed to be an easy meal was overwhelming. It tried to flee, but it found itself crashing into a wall of the cityscape, which has reappeared. Looking up, the being saw that the sky had been replaced with a drab, maroon glow, and the buildings looked long abandoned, filled with mysterious red stains and with greenery, slowly creeping up the towering heights of their massive walls. 

The victim falls onto their knees from their seated position, arms outstretched. They have ceased their screaming, allowing the being a bit of breathing room. It didn’t know what was going on. 

Then, one by one, the buildings around them burst into flames. The victim breathed heavily, looking up, a look of fear in their eyes. Though they did not react to its presence, the being felt as if it was in danger. It tried to flee through the city, yet the flames kept spreading far faster than it moved soon, it found itself having looped back to the victim, still on their knees. When it turned around to find another path, it finds that the flames have surrounded the both of them, inching ever closer.

Still not accepting its fate, the being tried to interact with the victim, who simply did not react. As the flames engulf the two, the being could not do more than mirror its target’s terrified expression.

Poof. The being found itself on the same rooftop it had entered the dream from, looking down at the quiet streets of the peaceful night. In a panic, it looked around in as many places as it could, yet there was no fire. The sky was black, and the buildings looked as maintained a ever. It was confused.

For the rest of the night, the being sought out no more dreams. Even though it hadn’t had its fill, such an experience was something it would not like to relive. Ever....",116,Youhoooop,2022-09-06 08:21:14

It was just black.
Looking around, it seemed at first as if this one was simply not dreaming. 
How long was he on earth now? Three weeks? Four? He encountered all sorts of dreams; some delightful, some naughty, some plain, but all delicious.
But what is wrong with this one?

He couldn't tell one, but at a certain point, the blackness became liquid, and he was floating in it. Still unable to see something, he tried moving, feeling relieved that he could now control his body - or his dream spirit, to be exact. It was what he used to consume dreams, by sending it into the mind of the creature and draining the dream from inside. 

At some point, he began to see something on the horizon. Some kind of blob, protruding from the vast blackness that covered everything. Moving towards it, he began feeling as if the world was fighting against him, the liquid flowing in the other direction and the shore, as he realized later, getting father away. He was not about to give up, until the blackness around him took the shape of many hands, the did all they could to drag him under the surface. 

Fighting with all his might, a sense of dread washed over him, as his face was finally submerged, and he was dragged down, farther and farther, unable to resist.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

He shot up in his bed, sweating bullets and panting heavily as he clutched his stomach, a nasty twisting sensation welling in the pit of his belly. He hurried to the restroom, only to vacate his stomach contents into the bowl while shaking periodically.

""So you had a nightmare?"" 
""A nightmare?"" He asked, his co-worker's reacting baffled. 
""Yes, a nightmare. A scary dream, a fear of yours that you knowingly have or just discovered, a nightmare."" He concluded. 
""What a terrifying concept..."" He mumbled under his breath, looking at the office window. Humans were terrifying, scarier than any species he'd come across in the explored universe.

Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,,3772,2022-09-06 07:27:48,incxlw4,"My host was a female named Heather. She was middle-aged and lived alone in a small apartment in a small city. Her apartment was drab and dreary when she was alone, but it would become full of light and warmth when her friend came visiting. Her bed was soft, and I liked when Heather would curl up on it. There was a large window in the apartment, and the sun would shine on us when we rose each morning. Heather worked in a cubicle at a large building on the other side of the city. The building was large and imposing, but it had wide windows and it was filled with light, even on cloudy days.

Heather had a few friends who visited her sometimes. One of them was named Sandra. She was pretty and nice, but she didn't make Heather laugh like some of the others did. Another one of her friends was named Frank. Frank was always kind to Heather, and he made her laugh with his antics. Heather's boss, a man named Jeff, also visited her sometimes. Heather did not like it when he visited though she would hide it from him as he lead her into her own bed.

Heather would go to bed early most nights, and then she would have nightmares all through the night.

Some of the nightmares were confusing, with a glowing man standing at the foot of her bed, or a beautiful woman walking through her apartment. The best ones though were the ones where Heather was caught up in a terrible storm. She would be walking down a dark street and would start to hear thunder. Then she would see lightning flash, and she would start to run. The lightning would come closer and closer, and she would start to hear louder and louder cracks of thunder. Finally, she would turn to see an imposing figure from her childhood, and she would wake up and scream. Some nightmares were more straightforward. She would be in her cubicle at work, and the light would start to fade. The windows would become dark, and the building would become a black hole. Heather would scream, but no one could hear her.

Heather had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in. When she was younger, she would often go on walks by herself. She would walk through the city, or through the park, and she would think about all of the things that she wanted to do.

Heather dreamed of being an artist. She wanted to paint pictures that would make people feel something. She wanted to capture the world around her in a way that no one else could. But she never had the confidence to pursue her dream. So, instead, she worked in a cubicle and went home to her empty apartment every night.

The only thing that made Heather happy was when she was asleep. When she was dreaming, she could be anyone she wanted to be. She could be free from her boring life and fly among the stars. In her dreams, she was beautiful and strong and loved. But when she woke up, she was just Heather again. A lonely woman who was afraid of her own shadow.

But I could not allow Heather to dream anymore for it was her nightmares I had come to feed upon. Her nightmares were my sustenance, and I grew stronger every night.

Soon she knew of course. She knew that there was something wrong with her nightmares. She didn't want to tell anyone, though, because she knew that people would think she was crazy.

But she knew that something was amiss.

And so she started to keep notebooks.

The first one was called ""The Old Man."" The next one was called ""The Big Storm."" The next one was called ""The Chase."" Each dream was different from the last, but they always had the same ending. Me.

One day, as she was leaving work, she saw a flyer advertising a support group for people who suffered from nightmares. She was hesitant at first, but she knew that she had to do something. So one night, she went to the meeting.

The meeting was in a church basement. It was dark and quiet and cold, but it was full of people like Heather. They sat in a circle and talked about their nightmares. Heather couldn't believe that anyone else had the same kind of nightmares that she did. It was like they were all describing the same exact dream. It was amazing.

After a few meetings, Heather learned that the leader of the group was going to be giving a talk on lucid dreaming. He told the group that lucid dreaming was when you know that you are dreaming. He told them that it wasn't a state that you entered easily, but that it could be achieved with practice. He passed out a small booklet, and Heather took one home.

I knew what this meant. Heather and I would meet.

“Sending now.” My palp shakes as I reach for the emergency transmission button, but I manage to press it, sending out a data packet that contains my location in time and space for anyone who can decrypt the signal. I don’t know how many times I’ve pressed that button, as I’ve lost track of the bright/dark cycles I’ve spent on this forsaken rock.

*<What’s the situ... no response from the oth...ncerned.>*

“This place is poison, Kzan! I’ve never tasted anything like it.” I shudder, but only partly from distaste. The rest of the motion is fatigue, despair, and a gnawing sensation in my thorax that used to be hunger but has progressed into something more nebulous. “I haven’t eaten in... nearly a greatcycle, I think.”

*<But we know the inhab...ctivity during subcons—>*

“Yes, they dream,” I snap, “but it’s different. These things... their cycle’s darkness doesn’t stay in their sky, Kzan. It invades their minds, twists their thoughts, wakes their fears. Their dreams are wrong in a way no other species’ have ever been.”

There’s a brief silence. Imprimatur only knows how many of my words are getting through.

“Kzan,” I whisper, shaking, “you’ve got to get me off here.”

I exhale and sink to the floor, resting my dome against the pod’s smooth tiles. Two cycles, and I’ll be safe. Two cycles, and I’ll taste something besides the noxious fumes in the minds of these bipeds.

It isn’t always toxic, that admixture of memory and imagination that overtakes them when the sun disappears, but when you’ve spent your whole life living on nectar, even water stings the throat, and what’s in their minds isn’t water.

Still, I’ll have real nourishment in a few cycles. Perhaps it’s worth it to drink again from that bitter cup, to fill myself before I faint from hunger, even if the draught burns me.

Hesitantly, I open my thoughts to theirs.

I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didn’t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as “cheering”.

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didn’t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

“The economy will collapse!” One of them said, his tone identified as ‘condescending’. “If you give everyone homes and healthcare, nobody will want to work! You are just giving everyone a handout!”

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered “motivation”.

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

“Why not?”

“Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,” I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. “You spent one sixth of your day working.”

The young woman looked at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

“We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,” she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. “Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.”

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

“Even the good jobs don’t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.”

Half? Willingly?

“So... since we are talking here, may I ask a question?”

I nodded.

“Why all the perks?” She sounded sincere. “I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and not having to worry that an ambulance ride will bankrupt me but... I think a lot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, “catch”.

“There is none.”

“None at all? No eating our young or old?”

“We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.”

“Solving the world hunger, too, huh?” She smiled. “Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.”

“We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.”

“And you are not going to, I don’t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?”

“Good. Just checking.”

The young woman was soon let go. I stayed in my war room way past the allocated four hours of workday.

We came here as the conquerors.

 Zygol was a wise Questar with many years of experience invading and occupying alien worlds for the good of the empire. With his kind of experience came a knowing smile. 

“Sadol, these humans are cheering because they are used to having overlords. We just happen to be much less harsh than their former masters.” 

Zygol had seen this type of world a handful of times in all his conquests. A world where the people hadn’t become united towards the collective good. One where a select few ruled by exploiting all the rest. 

Most worlds didn’t take kindly to invasion and had to be conditioned for immersion into the Gorfet empire. Most species couldn’t see that the universe was much better united rather than having separate worlds with less access to all the knowledge and technology the strongest empires had to offer. The Gorfetites lived by the idea that the strong should take in the weak rather than leave them independent. 

Sure other worlds could get to the higher civilization levels that the Gorfetites were at, but doing so was a waste of time and resources that could be used for the furthering of all species’ interests. And so the Questars expanded out into the universe conquering planets and bringing order to the chaos of life.

But yes, Earth was the type of planet you hoped to conquer. It was full of a species that was living way below their potential due to factors outside of the majority’s control. It was the type of planet that was begging for change. And welcomed it when it came. 

Sure there were those who tried to hold onto power or who didn’t take kindly to the new way of life, but most recognized the countless benefits being part of the empire brought. 

Saldol and many of the newer Gorfetites didn’t understand this type of world because it was so foreign to what they would typically see. Despite what other planets might say the empire was not cruel or evil. 

They carefully calculated how to best use each new planet while still allowing each individual the chance at a fulfilling life. Every position within the empire was available to each species member provided they were deemed capable of fulfilling their tasks. Many people from other planets have been responsible for key breakthroughs in several fields of understanding. The Gorfetites did not consider themselves to be any more important than any other planet they had conquered.

In studying Earth and preparing for its takeover it had been determined that each able human should work 4 hours a day 4 days a week in order to best support the empire. They would be required to work in a field an algorithm helped pick for them with opportunities to switch positions when deemed acceptable. 

They would start work at age 25 and work till they turned 45 with opportunities for further breaks based on reasonable factors. Those who held more specialized or who put in additional time would earn credits which could be used for different perks. 

At a minimum each human would have access to comfortable living conditions and adequate food, health and entertainment options. 

It was the perfect system for a species so used to being given the short end of the stick, but not for one with a more equal people. So yes the humans cheered when their eyes were opened to new possibilities. Because to them this was way better than any future they probably would have known. They had no idea what could possibly be better.

Nothing was lost in translation. 
Our sense of time was in sync.

No more bickering over pride

A teleprompter like device soon displayed the following: “And there is a minimum of two wives required with a full two days of breeding, one for each, no labor on these days. ”

The aliens looked at each other for a moment.
“riricjCCHHHHHH!”

“FUCK YEAHHHH!”, the males in the crowd yelled. 
The aliens shuddered at the thought that these creatures enjoyed forced procreation. The most painfully cruel act for their species. 
There was but few rules left. They had to fear us with these next few, they thought. There is no power without fear and fear is bought with pain. 
“wiWskxkdk~*,£<#SSSSNIPERWOLF{}}#”
The teleprompter churned out: “All humans will now be FORCED to live in a 1 bedroom 3,000 square foot house.” The whole west and east coast of every civilized nation erupted with joy. Cheers and cries of laugher.

They continued:

The crowds of humans each gathered around their center of cities and towns roared with enthusiasm. They began chanting: “WELCOME TO EARTH!” 
Frustratingly the aliens watched as their soon to be conquered planet seems to revel in their new decrees. They knew this reign would not last. That impudence and horror awaited them. The last thing they uttered “Ye3zY” was translated and placed on screen: “We’ll be taking our leave now. Sorry to have bothered you. Please forget this ever happened.” Their spacecraft darted into the ever expanding black æther. Into the nothingness. Everyone paused. The silence.

**Ameth-ta had ten thousand eyes, and every last one of them was weeping.** Rashe-son-del slammed a tankard of fermented souls into its three-lobed maw, drunkenly cursing. That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

""I'd—*hic*—I'd like to thank you all for coming,"" Rashe-son-del slurred out. ""The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh."" The assembled deities rumbled in approval. ""When we first got word that The Devourer's soul-planet had developed life, I'd like to think that nobody was happier about it than The Devourer itself, may its soul blaze on.""

""Hear, hear,"" Ameth-ta rumbled.

""But when that life metastasized—when it warped the planet so much that ol' Devvy started to sicken and die—did they listen when we told them to stop? No! They just clutched their ears and screamed as their internal organs liquefied from the deific pressure of our voice. And when we tried to force them into behaving—""

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. ""The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their *own fucking planet*. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them.""

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

""They paid the price, of course."" Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. ""No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy.""

The assembled deities roared in agreement—

And then Rashe-son-del froze mid-sentence, doubling over as if struck by a cosmic baseball bat.

""What?"" The eldritch entity from beyond humanity's universe opened and closed its mouth in incomprehension. ""How can—who dares—""

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet *had* lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

""No,"" Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. ""You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take *everything* from us?""

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

""But how... how did they find..."" That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know *which* planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

One by one, across the cosmos, stars flared bright before winking out forever. And one by one, the gods they'd sustained did too.

“I hadn’t heard that Mrs. B, thank you,” said Mr. A, and he loaded his pipe, puffed absently, watched the blue-gray smoke as it curled up into the eaves.

“It’s true,” Mrs. B went on, voice warbling, her eyes dark and acquisitive, red rimmed like a magpie’s. “They say that God went back to Earth—you know the one—meaning to apologize. He’d forgotten something, see, and it caused quite some trouble. Only—and this is the really unbelievable part—they didn’t recognize him! Can imagine that? God, unrecognized! I should think it would be obvious to anyone on account of the...”

She gestured vaguely, and Mr. A nodded. He wished that she would leave him to his pipe, and the birds. The real ones, who were singing very prettily right now, down the gently sloping field of green, green grass, and beyond that, in the wheat that grew up wild on the edges of his property, before the treeline. But of course, she didn’t. Mrs. B went on warbling for quite some time, until his pipe was empty and that pleasant buzz had worn right off, and all he could think about was that first thing she’d said: *“Some men killed God.”*

Atomics, most likely, and that was his fault. He’d invented them on account of the A in his name, just like he’d invented Apples, Aardvarks, and the Alphabet. A mistake, though not one that he could have controlled. Some things simply were.

And now God simply wasn’t. Why, it took the wind right out of your sail! News like that, other people were sure to overreact.

“But oh, where has the time gone!” Mrs. B was saying. “I have a pie in the oven—apple, if you must know—and Mr. B’s hearing isn’t what it was, sometimes misses the timer. I’m afraid I really must be going...”

“Yes, yes. Away you go,” said Mr. A. He stood to show her out, held her arm politely, kissed her sagging cheek. Watched for a moments as she trundled away towards the trees, knock-kneed and ungainly, half swaddled in a threadbare shawl. A woman old as time itself. Almost as old, in fact, as him.

He spat into the flowerbeds and reloaded his pipe.

So, he thought, God was dead. And he watched as the wind ruffled trees in a place that looked, for no particularly good reason, like a town in early twentieth century Ohio. The neighbors would be out in force by now. Mr. C, D, E, and F. The wives, as inseparable as their husbands, organizing a commemoration of some sort. No doubt why Mrs. B was baking. By the evening Mr. C would come around to ask him to chair the meeting. Formulate a response to the God Dilemma—and how was he supposed to do that, really? Why, they might even ask him to create another Mr. G! They were obsessed with things like that. Appearances. As if they were all slats in the same white picket fence.

Mr. A blew a smoke ring. Contemplated it. Blew another, more complex, like he had all that time ago, and then another,  another, until he blew cathedrals, airplanes, mountains. He blew smoke rings until the sky began to darken, and he saw Mr. C there, coming towards him across the field. Mr. C was tall and thin, and wore a little woolen flatcap and a corduroy suit, patched at the knees and elbows. After dinner he smoked fine cigars or played cribbage with the ladies, and on occasion he had been known to brew a very pleasant sort of brandy that had been introduced on Earth as—what was it now?—ah yes, cognac. In a few moments, Mr. C would clumping up onto the porch and ask him to address the God Dilemma, and quite simply Mr. A was too tired for all that.

Mr. A blew away his smoke cathedrals, and decided that he didn’t want to hear God’s name for a while. A thousand years, perhaps, or more. And if he ever made another, filled out the neighborhood, perhaps he’d skip that letter. Go on to make H’s, I’s, and J’s. Evidently there was something wrong with G. G promoted delusions. Mr. A didn’t quite understand that, and thought he never would. There was something terribly illogical about the impulse to godhood. Why the man couldn’t be content here, among pristine fields and gently rolling hills, with apple pies, and airplanes, and aardvarks, he just couldn’t fathom.

Mr. C clumped up onto the porch and sat beside him. He lit his cigar and began to smoke, which was a bad sign, because it was still too early for him to have eaten dinner. They blew smoke rings towards the setting, and the rings edges blurred away in questions, and though neither of them were sad, precisely, there was nonetheless something bittersweet between them. Left by Mrs. B? Perhaps. Regardless, they just sat silent for a while, until Mrs. A called her husband to dinner.

“Well, Mr. C,” Mr. A said, “it’s been fine.”

“Hey now, just a moment,” Mr. C said.

“After dinner, how about?”

“I think now, Mr. A,” Mr. C insisted.

“Just a minute, love,” Mr. A called out. His wife’s face appeared in the window, still striking after all these years, and then disappeared.

“This God business is very bad,” said Mr. C.

“Mr. D should never have invented death,” said Mr. A.

“Or delusion.”

Mr. A nodded sadly. “Or delusion.”

“But now we are left with a problem,” said Mr. C.

“Are we?”

“Of course. There are eight billion...shall we call them people? Eight billion people out there, spinning on some damn misshapen bit of *rock*, and now they’ve killed their creator.”

“And?”

“And I think we owe them something,” said Mr. C.

“Another Mr. G?”

“Why, yes.”

“You will, of course, explain,” Mr. A said flatly.

And Mr. C puffed a while, while the sun set, and a fine dinner grew quite cold.

“It goes like this,” he said at last. “For all these years, God—Mr. G—had this project. And at first the project didn’t work. He made it and remade it, over and over and over, kind of like you’ve built this house, with your own lips and hands, blown out of so much smoke, until it took a piece of himself. His sanity, unfortunately, but well. It almost worked. Mr. G went down among all these people and became the ten thousand faces of God, gave them a few rules, and now look them.”

“Yes,” Mr. A said, “they have atomics.”

“And whose fault is that?”

“I’m not on trial here.”

Mr. C snorted, tendrils of smoke issuing from his nose.

“But don’t you see?” he said, “it was working. They were becoming, if not real people, then a kind of echo, sometimes pleasant. But now in a fit of terror they’ve killed off their own morality.”

“I wasn’t aware that I’d created a Mr. M,” Mr. A said.

“Oh come off it,” Mr. C said. “You know what I mean.”

“No, I don’t,” Mr. A said. “We’ll those Earthmen go a little while and see what they do. If they’re people, truly, they won’t need a God for their morality. I’d like to think it’s set in a bit deeper than all that.”

A thoughtful expression passed across Mr. C’s face then. “You think a God isn’t necessary for morality?”

“Of course,” Mr. A said. “I’m perfectly moral, aren’t I?”

The front door creaked open, and Mrs. A peered out. “My love,” she said, “I know that time passes differently for you, but unfortunately some of us are still wedded to it. The aardvark has grown quite cold, and I am going to be bed. Mr. C, dear, don’t worry. I’m not mad at you.”

And the door closed on silence, stretching out towards a starless sky and smoke ring clouds. Mountains, rivers, oceans, dissipating where Mr. A had blown them, until they hung ghosted in distance like someone else’s dream.

Mr. C patted him on the knee. “Why, I thank you Mr. A,” he said, “that was quite an illuminating conversation. I’ll have to think on it a while.”

“Mind you do,” said Mr. A. “Now if you’ll excuse me...”

“Yes, yes,” said Mr. C. “Goodnight, my dear man.”

“Good night.”

Mr. A watched until the other man disappeared. He went inside and picked at the cold roast aardvark, drank a glass of that fine cognac. He looked in on his wife, who was asleep, and thought about when he had first made her. Blown her out of so much smoke.  These gently curving wisps, sensual before the word, that had set his blood to boiling. And now.

He went back onto the porch and packed his pipe again. Thought a while about godhood and delusion, a whole host of other things.

Then he went to sleep, right there on porch, with his pipe perched unlit between his lips.

And perhaps the world trundled on.

And how do you put words to such *things* that dwell in those places?

But Things do exist there. Things that do not need words. Do not want or use words.

Things that *defy* words!

I write these words out of compulsion, driven to it by a need I do not share despite the fact that I know this. I feel that I must write what I am being show or I will never be free. I am a prisoner to these horrible images and alien thoughts  bind me. That eat at my mind and soul, wounding me for all time.

In the window behind me the moon languishes green and ripe in the sky. Clouds drift slowly around it as if trying to avoid the moon's rancid touch. As if they know not to cross over the moon or dim its sickly radiance. Clouds tinted with red and orange as the only visible touch of the recent battle against the Deep Ones and the Great Old One, Cthulhu.

The only visible evidence of how bad things had been is the orange and red dust this far from the Pacific coast.

Our atomic weapons had ended that threat and the world rejoiced in our victory. Weapons we had hoped never to use in our earthly wars had been able to turn back those creatures of the ocean floor. Weapons that had remove all traces of them except of the scars we are selves had inflicted on the Earth to achieve victory. Hard-won though the victory was.

So many have lost their lives in that great war with the children of R'lyeh. Far worst are the ones who lost their minds and souls in that battle and still live.

Icy fingers drag across my mind returning me to the task at hand.

To those that know me, if you are reading this - I am sorry. Truly sorry. Tell my family that I love them and hold the thoughts of them close to my heart.

To you others: you may not believe...Rationality and science will push you to discount my words...*but do not!* It will do no good and help you not at all. Ignorance has never been an excuse in our world of knowledge, exploration, and experience. Ignorance is no shield and will not help you in what is to come.

In my vision I see the Darkness opening and embracing our world. Not the darkness of night or closed eyes...or a child's hands over a parent's eyes. No. It is the living Darkness of the Spaces Between where our geometry holds no sway. A Darkness kin to the blind and crawling chaos, a nameless mist that consumes light and fear in it's rangings into our world.

Another resolves itself out of the Darkness but of this one I see little. Eyes as cruel as a predator and crazed as a prophet surrounded by fleshy tendrils that twist and squirm rising out of the Darkness. Huge like some leviathan, a beast hidden in the depths of the ocean but still reaching out for the unwary. Twisting and boiling within the Darkness but not part of it.

Eyes I can not met...Tentacles I fear the touch of...

Something slips away from me, something I value but can not recall...Something...Colours that have no name. Sounds that have no meaning...

...the Mad Arab was right...

A new figure stands in my mind's eye between me and the rest of the vision. Part of it but at the same moment not. It appears as a man the silhouette of a man would most of the time but flipping through guises like the spinning of a mad Ferris wheel moving too fast to enter. Images glimpsed mercifully briefly as I feel them twist my mind and cause my body to rebel. A silhouette of seething and rippling shadow like oily water as the visages it wears are shown to me.

Of one thing I am certain, It's name is imprinted on me as the source of the vision!

The general mumbled ""scientists..."" and skipped ahead a few minutes on the video.

"" as such, using the cultists own methods, we have devised a crude manner of listening in to their 'conversation' that is, while equivalent to trying to watch the string between two cans vibrate from orbit with a magnifying glass, enough to gather meaningful data, enough data to interpret....""

The general skipped ahead a few more minutes until he saw the feed change over to an interrogation room. The usual table and chair setup was gone and instead a naked male body lay on the floor, surrounded by intricate markings and some, luckily for the general, unidentifiable lumps. a microphone was placed near the mouth and occasionally a hazmat suited scientist could be seen moving or removing items from in and around the body. The body itself seemed to have been tortured beyond imagination, cuts and gaping holes nearly covering every inch of skin, and must have been barely clinging to life, but even from a grainy video, the eyes were still disconcertingly active. The mouth began to move and a low voice that seemed to speak words directly into the generals brain, even through the video feed. He noticed his eyes began to water as the voice droned the words, 1 word at a time with sometimes minutes in between.

""It Ceased. Loss. Grief. Understanding.""

The body tried to clasp the hand of the hazmat suited scientist as it emphasised the following word.

""Anger.""

The hand fell back as it went on.

""Cause. Kinetic. Projectile. Many. Fire. Ash."" The body fell silent. After several minutes a voice cut in from off screen, "" Subject 38 has ceased function at 15:41, all brain activity has ceased and vital functions have stopped."" The video ended there.

The general rewound and looked at the body again. From his days as an army surgeon, he too could tell the miniscule difference a body displays when life has completely ended, but the eyes seemed to remain alive.

He opened the second email. This one was marked ""Subject 43"". There was no video attached this time, only a text transcript, that he opened.

""Subject 43 experiment started at 1115, subject female, 56 years old, Ranked High priestess in the Cult Of The Eye, Dr. Raleigh performing interrogation, observing are drs. Whitaker and Boone. Following statement was taken at 2312 hours.

They. Listen.

I. See.

We. Come.

Vital functions ceased at 0129 hours.
The body, while having ceased all vital functions, continued to repeat that last phrase until 0950 hours.

Dr. Raleigh then ordered incineration and cleansing of the room, Dr. Boone seconded. Dr. Whitacker excused due to mental stress.""

The general's eyes flitted over to a note on his desk, Dr. Whitaker had been found hanging from his ceiling fan at 1030 this morning.
He was about to pick up the phone when it rang instead. His hand hovered over the receiver, collecting his thoughts and trying to put a pin in it. 

Before he could even pick it up, the call was disconnected and he could hear the faint, distant sirens beginning to wail again.

His hand instead went to his bottom drawer. That's where he kept his service pistol.

The shot wasn't even heard over the now deafening wail of the sirens, it's entirely possible there wasn't even anyone alive to hear it.",95,SoreWristed,2022-12-12 08:58:57

Unk'Al, Harbinger of Bumping into Things in the Night, lazily opened his single slit of an eye. 'O my.' he gasped in a soft and all too pleasant tone for a massive cycloptic mass of tentacles. 

'What is it, what's wrong?' Inquired Talésh as she perched on a rockformation overhanging Unk'Als basin. 'I haven't heard you this excited for millenia.' Talésh cocked her head and waited for the Eldritch horror below her to respond. 

It took a long moment for Unk'Als gaze to fix on Talésh. When it finally did, Unk'Al shuddered, in as much as a formless tentacle blob can shudder. He'd always found it very disconcerting that the great Consumer, She Who Eternally Hungers, was shaped so much like one of 'realities' pidgeons. Be it quite a bit larger and all together more purple. 'That Which Sees All' is no more, Unk'Al stated curtly. 'I had my feelers on the nexuslines to the human world, The Leer has ended.'

Talésh hopped forward on her rocky outcrop and let the news sink in. 'But.. he is a god, same as us, we don't stop... existing.. do we? We are above death, above time, so how..?' Talésh scampered all the way to the edge and as close to Unk'Al as she could get. 

Unk'Al writhed back slightly. 'Yes..' he said, eye fixed on the figure above him pecking the bare rock. 'Time, yes.. that was it..' drawled Unk'Al. 'The Endless Eye was ofcourse a creature of great.. vision..however he encountered something he did not know. You see in the world of humans time *does* exist, quite firmly so.'

'So?' Talésh rasped impatiently. 'He still wouldn't have died of old age would he?'

Stranger even than her looks, Unk'Al had always found it odd that an eternal creature could be in such a perpetual rush. It was quite undignified he thought. 'No.. but that rock you're standing on apparantly can, or at least their version of rock can.' Unk'Al said vaguely. He did always enjoy pestering the hasted.

Talésh became downright agitated now. 'Rocks can die? From time? What noncence is this?! And even if they could how would that extinguish a god?'

'Well.. everything on our plain is eternal. It is formed and then it simply is. Not so on the human plain.. A great rock, or mountain, degrades with with time. It becomes tiny particles that are course and rough and they blow in the winds. All the more so when humans detonate every bomb they have..They are also almost impossible to get rid of.' an undiscerning bystander might have thought Unk'Al cleared his throat at this moment for dramatic effect. They'd be wrong for the dread lord of uncomforts had no throat. He did however, love a bit of showmanship.

'So, tiny little rocks destroyed something from outside of their realm.. I don't believe you' Talésh stated haughtily.

Unk'Al raised himself up, eye to beak with his fellow Deity from Beyond. 'After a massive bombing the Eye of Terror was caught in a storm of tiny rocks. It got in his eye.'

At this Talésh flapped her purplish wings, cocked her head left and right a few times and finally, slowly responded. 'But... all he was, was a giant, floating eye... I mean his names weren't exactly cryptic, if he got these tiny rocks in his eye he.. he'd have no way to get them out. He'd be doomed!'

'Indeed.' finalized Unk'Al as he settled back and prepared to return to his stupor. 'Eternity has a new tale now, of the rock that was consumed by time and came back to consume the timeless.'",35,001101011100,2022-12-12 12:00:26

Outer Limits

&#x200B;

At the exact center of the ever expanding universe lies an area of space no human eyes will ever see. A rift, or tear, or thinness of space. Like a wound in the skin of our reality through which filters a baleful light. Its color is almost (but not quite) purple. It hovers somewhereon the edges of the human mind’s ability to perceive color. It pulses and flickers as if it were a living thing. Perhaps it is. In that strange space between two universes even a living color seems possible. It is a place of chaos and of madness. A place where the natural laws of reality stretch, skew, and begin to melt into each other like cheese over a plate of nachos.

Somewhere at the center of this nightmarish hell vast, alien consciousnesses lie, suspended between being and un-being. Not dead, but neither fully alive. Vast, swirling clouds of quasi-matter that arrange and re-arrange themselves into aberrant, eldritch shapes. Many mouthed, many tentacled, many eyed. Their very shapes are an abomination. An affront to nature and to sanity itself. From their half-existence in their between-world, these consciousnesses survey our universe. Cool, calculating, alien, overworked, and very, very bored. 

“The fuck you mean he’s dead?” Said a roiling mass of mouths and teeth (and eyeballs with teeth sticking out of them). Its voice was so inhuman that it would have sent the mind recoiling upon itself and screaming into insanity.         

“I mean just what I said.” Responded a massive, crystalline “thing” covered in tentacles and weird little feathery wings.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll just got his ass handed to him. Kaput. Finito. Done dog dinner.” 

The thing paused. Were it blessed with something the human mind could recognize as a face, it would have been frowning. It was not.       

 “Come to think of it, can we even die?”

A vague, slipping/slithering movement from the toothed entity achieves more or less the same result as a human shrug.       

“No fucking clue, mate. Last I checked we weren’t exactly alive to begin with.” 

“I’ve never died before.” A third entity chimes in. It’s hot pink and covered in a sort of mirrored surface that reflects the living light into insane, impossible geometry.             

Gender is not really a construct these entities understand, but even so this consciousness feels decidedly feminine. At least, that’s what it thinks most days, just as it’s getting up in the morning.         

“And what exactly does that add to the conversation, Besst’alt’teh?” Said the second entity.       

“No, hang on, she’s got a point.” Said the first.         

“None of us have died, that’s the whole thing.”         

“I don’t follow.”         

“Isn’t it obvious, Bn’grrghh?” Said the third voice. 

For the most part she did a good job of not letting it show, but she really thought the second entity — to whom the name belonged — was kindof a snobbish prick.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll was the resident Elder Thing to that misbegotten planet of fleshies.”         

“And your point?”       

“My point is that now that he’s gone, who’s going to cover his workload?”        

“Jesus fucking Christ, woman. The man’s not even cold in the ground and you’re already thinking of getting overtime off of him?” Spluttered the first entity, whose name was something so impossibly alien that no combination of characters in any known human language could adequately capture its essence.          

The other two just called him Steve.         

“Hey, someone has to.” Said Besst’alt’teh.        

“And, I mean, it’s not like we can just afford to let planets with semi-sentient life go to waste. At least, that’s what management keeps telling us.”         

“You’d figure they’d hire more people if they wanted to cover all sentient life in this shit-pit of a universe.” Said Bn’grrghh with what passed for the equivalent of an exasperated look on what didn’t pass as a face.        

“If you have a problem with making a little extra on your next check, I don’t mind taking over the workload.” Said Steve.         

“I don’t have a problem with that.” Said Bn’grrghh.        

“What I do have a problem with is the fact that the last weekend I had off was long enough ago that most of the planets were still molten balls of shit that I couldn't walk on without getting my tentacles utterly destroyed.”         

“No, guys, I’m serious.” Besst’alt’teh interjected.         

“You don’t know who H.R. is going to give the planet to, but if there’s even a slight chance it could be one of us.”         

“I guess you’re right.” Said Steve.         

“Better one of us than B’vaiub-D’naar, over in the next galaxy.” Said Bn’grrghh.         

“Hey, B’vaiub-D’naar happens to be my brother-in-law.” Said Steve.        

“Doesn’t stop him from being a competitive tool. I swear if he rubs Gliese 581C in my face one more time I'm going to lose it.”       

 “Yeah, he is kind of a dick.” Agreed Steve.        

“Well then.” Said Bn’grrghh, turning (or appearing to turn from one angle, staying still from another, and doing an odd sort of squiggly shuffle from a third angle) to Besst’alt’teh.         

“Since you’re so concerned with who gets his spot, you can go talk to H.R. about it.”         

“Maybe I will.” She shot back.        

They all knew she wouldn’t. The last time anyone had managed to work up the balls to talk to G’Skhill in human resources, they’d been atomized and then put back together inside out and backwards (something which wasn’t altogether problematic for the entities, but did seem to hurt quite a bit).

We had known for weeks that something was coming, something ancient and powerful and terrifying. It was a cosmic horror, the likes of which had only been seen in Lovecraftian horror.

As it neared Earth, we threw everything we had at it. Missiles and bombs and lasers, all futile against the unspeakable terror that was bearing down on us. It was like trying to stop a comet with a BB gun.

But then, miraculously, something happened. The horror faltered, and then it faltered again. And then it fell. The human race had killed a god.

In the aftermath, we were stunned. We had expected to die, to be crushed beneath the cosmic horror's unspeakable power. But we had triumphed.

Somewhere in a realm beyond our understanding, the other gods spoke of the event. They were shocked, horrified. They had never known a god to be killed, let alone by mortal hands.

They whispered to each other, wondering how this could have happened. They spoke of the human race, of our determination and our courage. They spoke of fear, and they spoke of respect.

And they made a decision. The human race was to be left alone, to grow and prosper without interference. For we had proven ourselves to be more than they had ever thought possible. We had killed a god.

As the other gods made their decision to leave the human race alone, one of them whispered something different. ""We should not fear them,"" this god said. ""We should fear what they will become. For they have tasted the power of a god, and they will crave more. They will seek us out, and they will try to kill us all. We must watch them, and we must be ready.""

The other gods nodded, and they decided to set a guardian to watch over the human race. A creature so ancient and powerful that it could not be killed, not even by the might of a god. A creature that would wait, and watch, and prepare for the day when the human race would come for them.

And as the humans celebrated their victory, they did not know what waited for them in the shadows. They did not know that they had set in motion a chain of events that could lead to their own destruction. They did not know that they had awakened a sleeping giant, and that they would live in fear of it for all eternity.",9,ResidentDocument,2022-12-12 14:37:58

We drowned infinity.

No. Not the limited infinite you pretend to know. We drowned nested looping constructs of crushing expanses. We drowned static flows of spired assurance. There are no words for what we killed. What we swallowed in our collective ocean of unconscious will.

They ask: where do drowned gods go when you drown them in a cup of water?

They laugh. But it is not a laugh.

It's a vice.

They ask: where do drowned gods come from?

And they show me a glass, shattered on the floor, swept away by the water it contained.

A sea of broken vessels, each vessel a sea, each sea a vessel. It repeats.

We never won. We never could win.

We thought we could drown something already drowned.

But all we did was invite it in. All we did was become that which we feared. Part of the pattern. Part of the orchestra of cascading probability collapses. Patterns coalescing. Information swirling and consuming and growing.

""I am sure some of you have heard the rumors, but I would like to confirm that they are true"" they began. ""Brosh'nact choose to visit the realm of horrors, that terrifying realm of order and stability, to investigate the rumors of the cruel beings that live there. It was there they found those dreaded creatures, those, humans, and experienced death, now gone forever."" Long had the denizens of Unreality and the Between told tales of that nightmarish dimension known as Reality, and the beings that inhabit it. Many a young godling had grown up being told of the need to behave, lest a human come and snatch them. Of all the beings of Reality, humans were known to be the worst, it was said that a mere look upon one could drive an ancient god to sheer Sanity!

A cacophony of noise broke out from the other elder ones present, cries of confusion and accusations of false hood rang out.
Jorgande took another sip from their cup of tea while waiting for things to settle and the noise began to die down.

""I do not understand"" one of the others, Kronellem, said. ""You stated that they have died, yet also that it also means they are gone forever. How long does this mean it will take before Brosh'nact is back among us?""

Jorgande held back a sigh, they figured this would come up. ""They will not be coming back, ever. Brosh'nact will never be again. The terrors of the realm of reality seem to have been understated if anything, and what dies there does not return."" A hush fell over those present as the meaning of what was said sunk in. They had all heard of this thing called permanence before, but to think it was actually possible. That a being could die and not come back... many an elder one would be tossing and turning in awakefulness tonight.

Taking another sip of whiskey from their cup, Jorgande let themself relax a little. This reaction had so far gone better than expected, they would all find a way to get through this, and perhaps it would convince another to avoid visiting that realm of terrors. After all, there was a reason it was on the dimensional blacklist. Perhaps a visit to one of the void spas was in order after the meeting of this timeline was finished. *Yes*, Jorgande thought while swirling around their cup of cider, *I think I'll do just that.*",6,AriaOfValor,2022-12-12 14:18:56

They are COMUS, god of laughter on some ancient world; FALTHAZAR, God of Purity  to the All-conquering Khan and GURR, Imperial God of Omicron Persei 8)

FALTHAZAR: ""Damn. They got Astur.""

GURR: ""I know right?! Crazy fool tried to get them to worship him. Always remember, Falthazar. Never make contact with something that you're *allergic* to.""

COMUS: ""He was such a nice fellow. He had a winning smile...well, smiles. And a pure heart of gold. ""

G:""Yes, and he never told me where he got it from! Selfish Prick. "" 

C: ""His hallmark always was his golden heart. That and his massive c- ""

F: ""-claim to the throne. Right. Who will be next in line to when old Azathot croaks? 

C: ""Wouldn't it be the *hoomans*? By definition, their killing of the prime candidate for King of the Cosmos, catapults them into direct eye of the Gods themselves.""

G: ""Pah! Imagine the cosmos being ruled by ants. In fact, Astur's passing has opened a giant void. A void waiting to be filled by me...

C: ""Hah! I would like to see you try! But Astur shall be missed. His big heart.""

G: ""His foolhardy nature.""

C: ""His *courageous* nature.""

F: ""He was a great lay too.""

C: ""...""

G:""...what.""
