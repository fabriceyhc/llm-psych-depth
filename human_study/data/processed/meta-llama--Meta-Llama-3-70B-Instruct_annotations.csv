Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings.  Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask.  I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.  

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation.  I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like.  A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for.  The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right.  Something was missing.  That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense.  There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand.  It was truly a marvel of technology.  Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny.  Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries.  A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface.  His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did.  I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight.  And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well.  A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...",219,Obtuse_Mongoose,2023-02-17 20:57:55

They were both vampires and more importantly, best friends going back nearly 300 years now. It wasn't unusual for one to not hear from the other but it had been weeks now without his friend answering his letters. Normally they wrote one another every few days. It was unusual to say the least.

Elric feared the worst and tred cautiously in the night. Razmat was not always the most careful and hunters were always coming up with new ways to track their kind. He first checked the mailbox. It was overflowing with junk mail and his letters. Not good. Not good at all. He peered into one window and then the next. No signs of Razmat still. He briefly decided leaving, but Razmat had risked his life for him too many times. If this was a trap, Elric would just have to kill the wretched hunters who had stolen his friend from him.

Elric steeled his nerves and then procured the spare key Razmat has always kept hidden under the dirty red and white garden gnome closest to the door. He made a note to chastise his friend again on the pathetic hiding spot should he seem him once more.

With a careful twist of a key and knob he stepped inside. He could feel the adrenaline spiking in him. His whole body tensed. Ready to flee or fight he called out in a hushed voice, ""Razmat!"" Nothing. ""Razmat, you old fool!"" Nothing. Then he heard it. A soft cry or perhaps deathrattle.. ""Ahhhhhhhh.."" It was Razmat. He was still alive. The sound had come from the library located just behind the door atop the stairs. 

Elric would not give the hunters a chance to hear him or finish the job if there was still time. He barred his fangs, and with great vampiric strength and speed exploded through the door. Razmat was seemingly alone and lying on the floor under some kind of heat lamp and a device on his head with two devices strapped to his wrists. Clearly some kind of torture or magic from the hunters. ""NO! Razmat! Speak to me! Who did this to you?!"" 

Razmat yelped in surprise and took off his VR headset, ""Wha? Elric? What are you- What happened to my door?!"" Elric's face sped through half a dozen emotions. Grief. Fear. Confusion. Relief. Happiness. Embarassment. ""I.. I thought you were in danger. You stopped writing. Your mailbox was full. You were on the ground... What is this device that has snared you?""

""Ohhhh, yes, yes! I'm sorry dear Elric."" Razmat chuckled and looked guilty. ""I guess I have been getting carried away. I had my familiar introduce me to this new gadget called ""Vee Arrr""! It's amazing! Elric, you'll never believe it! Please you must try it!"" Elric eyed his friend warily and took a half-step back, ""If this is a trap Razmat.. Blink twice. I will not rest until I free you."" Razmat just gave his friend a stern look, one a father might give a child trying to get out of trouble with a ridiculous story. Razmat reached out his hand offering the headset to his friend. ""Elric, please. This isn't a trap. It's fun! Put this on.""

Elric sighed and cautiously examined the device. ""Vee Arrr"".. He had heard the term once or twice, he was fairly sure. Neither were known to keep up with the recent trends as some of the younger vampires. ""Okay, Razmat. For you."" With a deep breath he fastened the headset to his head and opened his eyes. Immediate regret. ""GHAST! TREACHERY! LIES! RAZMAT YOU'VE BETRAYED ME! NO! AHHHH!"" He pulled his cloak over his body and then.. Laughter? Razmat was laughing? Wait. He wasn't burning. ""What is this magic?"" Elric stammered. ""This is what I wanted to show you! Vee Arrr! We can live in the daylight again, friend! Through these devices! It's amazing! What sights there are to see! It's all I've done since we last spoke!"" Elric examined the sunlight around him. It looked so much like it did all those hundreds of years ago. He took off the headset and began to weep. ""I know, friend. I know. You get used to it. Slowly."" Razmat began to point at the heat lamps ""Look here, I even have heat lamps to give the sun warmth! It's the full experience! Dry your tears and lie on this mat here."" Elric smiled softly, ""very well."" and put back on the headset. It was a virtual world simulating a nice beach on a sunny day. Elric rested on the mat which was perfectly positioned to be on a beach chair and felt the ""sun"" bask his skin. ""Ahhhhhhh.."" Elric slowly exhaled in a state of bliss. ""You must show me how to get one of these for myself.""",403,DoomGloomAngst,2023-02-17 19:29:09

Admittedly he had the misfortune to fail at both, as given what he now was death would not be an untimely occurrence and he’d have to perish purposefully if he saw fit to do so. 

Still, it was always something to see when society pushed the envelope and created something never before seen, and entertainment had been no less magnificent. Gerry liked simple pleasures when he could find them. Petting the occasional stray cat that wandered onto his property at night was the liveliest of happenings, as he tended to keep away from the small town nearby. It made him feel closer to the earth to allow the forest around his modest cabin to provide sanctuary.

When years become decades and decades become centuries one tends to lose patience for trends and routine becomes a boon. The flow of life blurs together into a fog that always seems more or less the same no matter what changes are witnessed. Films and television had been an interesting development as the entertainment certainly provided a way to pass the time at the very least. Holed up far and away from most civilization Gerry had put off electricity for the longest time until he realized the artificial light could feel warm if the voltage was high enough. It wasn’t a sunrise, but it was something. 

It was easy to miss the warmth and the light if he was being honest; as he had been a farmer's boy something young. The feel of cold damp earth in his hands under the warmth of the sun was nothing but imagination now, and he had long since lost the memory of how pink the sky could be at sunrise. Fires in his wood stove were nice, but the light still wasn’t right. It wouldn’t brighten up the sky and sunbeams wouldn’t shine through the trees at dawn in his cabin, but it was alright. 

Digital media was eventually added to Gerry’s long list of hobbies, though remained near the bottom as simply watching events play out was already a very long tried and true pastime. More engaging activities always caught his interest and held it, and the creation of video games had initially intrigued him simply because it required direct input. 

The initial release of small puzzles created with pixels of light from electricity on a glass screen had been fun enough to follow, so he did for a little while. Every year that passed saw improvements to these generated images, though the advent of color television temporarily distracted him from generated shapes in games, as movies once again took a spotlight.

The sun in those films was always wrong though, always... off in some way. The studio lighting casting improper shadows and unrealistic flatness, paling in comparison to the real thing. It seemed a lost hope that anyone would ever be able to capture a real and proper recreation of the sun. Gerry still kept a small ember of hope smoldering deep in his core that provided comfort on days when he found the world felt a little colder.

It was years later that he cycled through a few hobbies he liked to fall back on when he decided to bite the metaphorical bullet and invest in new technology for his small homestead. The faithful color television had finally crackled a final hum and failed to display a picture. The tiny screen remained a glossy dark mirror that showed nothing but an empty room in the dim glow of the fire. 

Blessedly, it was the dead of winter. Days were brief while nights remained long and the sun dipped below the horizon well before evening properly set in. Heading into town was not ideal, but online shopping never appealed much to Gerry. It was due to the fact that he was genuinely quite old fashioned and still preferred to physically see what he would be acquiring before purchase. 

Admittedly he had been eyeing new televisions for quite some time, though age had tempered his impulses to general practicality at best and desperate longing for old familiarity at worst. Gerry maintained an awareness of technological advances as it would do him no benefit to remain ignorant, but remained skeptical that fifteen years could really make much of a difference. 

Fifteen years had apparently made quite a lot of difference, both in quality and in possibilities to explore. He found himself asking the young man at the counter what all he would need to play this new game with a beautiful sunrise depicted on the back of the case. Gerry left with a shard of hope lodged deep in his chest and a purchase that funded the business owners for the next month.

It ached as he set everything up, the cold metal and wires feeling like they held anything but life in them. He was an old man in the body of someone who had never known age and never would. The cold darkness of mountains and forest all he had known for so long it was all he thought he *wanted* to know.

The light from the screen occupying his living room had been practically blinding when he turned it on, stark white and bright logos disorienting and crisp. It was too sterile and had no depth of color, and it was not a sun but a flare. Still cold and unyielding in its intensity of artificial brightness.

Gerry picked up the controller and was almost hesitant to see what might be waiting for him. The warmth from his fire was smoldering, a hearty blaze reduced to soft crackling and a muted glow. 

Making his digital approximation of self on the screen he dove into the artificial world with an eagerness that could only be described as raw and unburdened. He was someone else on the screen, and it looked *amazing*. So caught up with how people and surfaces were displayed in front of him he almost forgot why he had made the purchase to begin with. Until he saw it. 

There, in a false sky inside a screen of light inside his cabin, was the sun. Rays of dawn were cresting over a mountain top reflecting off the blinding snow and painting the landscape with glorious warmth. This was a world he could enjoy in the light of day. 

If he closed his eyes as the pinks and oranges of the sky lit up his room the warmth of the fire felt akin to sunlight for the first time in centuries, and it was magnificent.",45,Gallifrey63,2023-02-17 22:59:19

The noise sounded like a sigh, mixed with a hiss, yet it was somehow happy at the same time. He stood in his open doorway looking down at the ground, where laid an Amazon delivery. 
Velstat's eyes widened as he studied the small plastic bag. He gazed upon this plastic bag with the same look he gave his prey. This delivery was as equally intriguing. It had arrived a full night early.
 ""How fantastic"" he thought. 

For a moment he was looking, studying the minute details and curves of the bag and its smooth white plastic coating. As it reflected off the dull light above, he was reminded that soon he would know the Sun again. At least, he would know it in higher 3D graphical fidelity than any 3D media before. And the next moment, within an instant, he was  holding the plastic package tight against his chest, his door already closed. 

He slit open the plastic bag with his nail and into his palm fell the new Blood Drinker game. Blood Drinker 3: The Viking.

 Velstat was expressionless as he slid the game into his Xbox 9000. Not only was this game using the newest Puretime rendering software, but it also ran on Matrix-Net Tracing. Truly nothing else could render a normal day as good as this game would. It might even look prettier than the real day. A wicked smile crept across his face at the thought. Ah yes soon he would be playing it. Relishing in the Suns bright touch. Nearly day-dreaming, he thought of how he would soon be moving his character throughout the world, through the day while looking up on the most beautiful Sun ever created. And soon he could look upon this beautiful sun.

 Velstat sat on his couch with the posture of a marble statue. As he picked up his controller Velstat let out a small stifled laugh, which turned into a full on below. He was laughing at God. Velstat had no care for the Sun. He didn't really miss it, in fact he hated it. But this was about beating God at his own twisted game. Velstat would win this battle. 
A small victory in this damnation he thought. 
""Yes...""Looking up towards his ceiling,  ""For about 8 fun hours I will soak up as much Sun as I can. And there is nothing You can do to stop it!"" He snarled the last part out loud, pointing his finger up at the ceiling, towards God.

Velstat had other reasons to play, besides pulling a cheeky one on God of course. He was a fan of the first two Blood Drinker games, but this one would be special. He was very old, so old he didn't remember most of his past. But he remembered enough. He was at one time a Viking. He knew Blood Drinker 3: The Viking was not going to be historically accurate but it seemed fitting that in this show of rebellion against the Almighty,  that the main character  should also be a Viking. Velstat finished off his glass of very Red Wine and pressed play.

The graphics were awing. Even his Vampire eyes were completely stunned at the realism. In game, he moved his character through a forest and he could see as the Sun peaked between the trees. Velstat stepped into the open field, soaking in the beautiful day, marveling at the brightness. When suddenly in real life, he burst into flames.",15,LightBlindsAtFirst,2023-02-18 01:04:54

The color in the sky was getting brighter. Victoria grinned widely as she peered at the screen. It was a ritual she performed in games like this, anticipating the sunrise and then stopping to watch it. A wistful sigh escaped her ancient, youthful lips. It took her back hundreds of years to the last time she watched the dawn. A dawn she took for granted and never realized it would be her last.

""Vikkie!"" A familiar voice called from another room, startling Victoria out of her reverie.

Victoria paused the game and set down her Switch to approach her bedroom door. ""I'm in my room.""

Footsteps. Familiar ones. Anne! ""Cover up, the sun is still getting through some of the windows."" Anne said.

Mindful of how the Sunlight might enter her room she backed away and picked up her robe, wrapping it around her and pulling the hood over her head. The door opened and closed quickly--just enough to let Anne through.

""Okay, it's safe, Vikkie."" Anne said.

Victoria pulled back her hood and looked for Anne. The woman stood a few paces into the room from the door. Following the modern, comfortable fashion, Anne wore a gray hoodie and form fitting jeans. It was distasteful to Victoria--she preferred the elaborate fashions from her time. Fashions that hid more of the shape of the body, but she was working on that.

""Greetings, Anne."" Victoria said, approaching the woman with arms open. Then she noticed the box between them--keeping them from their usual greeting embrace. ""What's this?""

""Hi, Vikkie."" Anne looked down, directed by Victoria's words. ""Oh, it's a present.""

""A present?"" Victoria echoed quizzically.

""Mmhmm! For Valentines!""

""You know I can't have chocolate...""

""It's not chocolate.""

Victoria narrowed her eyes at the package before taking it in her hands and moving to her desk to begin opening the brown box. ""You should have wrapped it."" Victoria noted blankly.

""I thought you said wrapping paper was quaint and unnecessary. 'It serves no purpose.'""

Having removed the tape and started opening the flaps, she looked up at Anne with a steely gaze. ""Well, maybe I just like it. It's pretty.""

Anne giggled and drew closer, draping her arms around Victoria's neck and shoulders and kissed the top of her head. ""I'm sorry. I'll use 'frivolous decoration' next time.""

Victoria shook her head while she removed her gift from a variety of boxes out of the brown box. When it sat on her desk there was what looked to be a dark brick with straps to hold it on the head and wands with rings at the ends.

""What is it?"" Victoria asked, uncertain how to express herself with regard to the odd gift.

""It's a VR headset."" She said, reaching past Victoria to grab the wands. ""And these are the controllers. I told you about VR.""

Victoria raised her brows and pursed her lips. ""The simulated reality device?"" She asked cautiously.

Anne nodded. ""That's right. I know you've been wanting to experience watching the sunrise again... I know watching it as Link isn't enough.""

""Anne..."" Victoria pressed her brows together in a grateful expression and drew Anne's face down with one hand to press a kiss against her cheek. ""Thank you. But... I don't want to experience this without you either.""

""You won't have to, Vikkie."" Anne assured her. She stepped back and slipped her backpack from her shoulders. ""I have my own."" She said as she set her carry storage for her own headset and controllers on the desk. ""I'll be with you.""

They took the time to set up the devices and get into the headsets. They moved into a private VR world together.

""It's..."" Victoria trailed off, astounded by how similar this world was to the world she knew.

""Surprisingly realistic?"" Anne giggled. ""I know. The weirdest parts are the floating menus, aren't they.""

Victoria nodded.

""Are you ready?"" Anne asked, moving close. Blindly, she dropped her controller and took Victoria's hand, interlocking their fingers.

""I'm not sure...""

Taking it as a yes, Anne pointed her controller and clicked the button to initiate the gradual sunrise. Then she dropped the other controller and held onto Victoria. ""I'm right here. You're safe. I'm excited to see this with you.""

A soft croaking noise came from Victoria's throat. Her golden eyes slowly widened as she saw the rays of the simulated sun reaching over the horizon. Though she didn't need to breathe, she often did and now--now she held her breath. It felt like something powerful enveloped her ancient heart and like a wonderful knot of joy was being pulled up through her. As the light of that golden sphere hit her eyes she started to feel warm tears welling up in her eyes. The crimson tears streamed down her cheeks. Overwhelmed with emotion she instinctively sought out Anne's presence and squeezed her hand.

""I'm here. It's beautiful isn't it?"" Anne said softly, squeezing Victoria tightly.

Victoria nodded and sniffled wetly. ""Anne...""

""Yes, Vikkie?""

""Thank you..."" She croaked.

""You're welcome."" Anne replied. ""I love to see your joy.""

""I love you, Anne....""

""I love you too, Victoria.""",24,_SapphicVixen_,2023-02-17 23:08:02

A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter. 

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived. 

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",7,MarshallSorrows,2023-02-18 01:16:10

Sickness and despair, families torn apart, entire economies in shambles. 

A new source of sustenance we were told.  An inexhaustible supply of the richest dreams ever found.  Most sentient species dreamed infrequently and only then short periods. They had evolved from sleep to hibernation where dreams do not exist.  Eons of space flight across galaxies and the time required to get there had forced an evolutionary change on almost all species. 
A few species still existed for us to harvest from but these were simple,  joyless and bland. They brought little satisfaction apart from keeping the pangs of hunger at bay. 

Then I found it. Earth as it is called. 

Billions of sentient beings. Each one with unique dreams as varied as the number of stars. Our process for harvesting was painless and left no trace. And, far as we had determined,  it had no ill effects on the humans.  They had an inexhaustible supply of dreams.  We could sustain our entire populace on less than 10% of this planet.  

Early samples were promising.  So much so that I skipped testing for side effects.  In a thousand millennia we had only ever come across a handful of harmful effects and even then,  it was only when we harvested from a source caught in the event horizon of a black hole. Thier spaghettified minds being torn apart in that unending moment made a few of our species go mad. 

So I harvested dream upon dream. 
I had tried to find dense population centers to harvest for expediency. I only occasionally fed as needed. Two or 3 dreams would be more than enough for my journey home. A child's dream of a sunlit field, birds singing and their pet dog running beside them. It was delightful. 

A young adult male was playing his favorite sport at the highest levels with great success. This one filled me up so much so that I skipped 3 cycles before my next one. 

I think they are called veterans.  
The realization that this human was reliving actual moments they had experienced was unlike anything I had ever tasted.  The fear, self loathing at failing to save a comrade, the unbridled hatred but most of all the sadness.  It was horrible and exhilarating at the same time. I hated myself for it but couldn't stop. It consumed every fiber of my being  I could not live without more of it.  It didn't offer any nourishment or benefit but I could think of nothing else.  I knew I was wasting away,  ignoring basic needs to consume more and more of these nightmares as they were called but I couldn't stop. 

When I arrived at my home world I was near death.  Unconscious,  I was taken to our healing center.  In the meantime my stores of dreams were unloaded and distributed.  I was unable to warn them. 
When the dreams I harvested from what the humans called a VA hospital, were consumed, a riot ensued.  We had never known violence against one another but the need to get more of these dreams was so strong that all reason was abandoned.  It was determined that mature human dreams should not be consumed. 


Not wanting a repeat of the riots the next batch, from young humans was released. From what humans called an orphanage.

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and *bloody*.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, *ever*, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a *nightmare* tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",1203,SirPiecemaker,2022-09-06 09:13:46

Watching as the human laid trapped in a spider’s web, unable to move. Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

 

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldn’t eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes in it.

 

As the spider revealed itself, the human only grew more panicked, making small mumbles in their sleep as they tossed and turned until finally Xai relieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the human’s ears, slowly drifting into Xai’s skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

 

Even after being fed, Xai couldn’t leave the human’s side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mind’s way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

 

Xai took another look into the human’s mind, finding this dream far more realistic. The dream consisting of the human sitting beside a family member, discussing something that appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect example of a brain making sense of things that had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from?
The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alien’s mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

 

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didn’t know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind. Xai hovered above the bed before vanishing in a blink of light, returning to their ship.",330,sadnesslaughs,2022-09-06 08:45:39

“These humans do not just have dreams. They have these horrible, twisted dreams called nightmares, where everything is terrible. I’m returning home.”

The Hexalians anxiously awaited Kashitok, expecting to see a shaken and defeated comrade. When he first appeared, their fears seemed true. His face, once healthily green, approached a brownish colour that would lead many Hexalians to shake their head and mournfully prepare a permanent send-off into the darkness of space.

What was strange, however, was the radiant smile on Kashitok.

“You look positively psychotic,” mission commander Laxok said. “Your expression and your complexion do not match.”

“I know, sir,” Kashitok said. “I think I need a lie down, and a long time in a proper toilet. But I’ll give my report soon.”

After a Hexalian hour of the entire space base trying to ignore the sounds coming from the washroom, Kashitok finally emerged with a much healthier colour.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “I understand if you need more rest due to the harrowing experience.”

“Oh, I actually feel quite good,” Kashitok said. “Refreshed, even.”

“If you say so,” Laxok sighed. “You did well, emissary.”

“Those nightmares,” Kashitok felt his tongue instinctively rub across his lips. “They are strange. It kind of burns your tongue.And your face. Maybe you get a headache.”

“That sounds utterly horrifying,” Laxok said gravely. “I’m so sorry. I’ll henceforth strike off Earth as a potential hunting ground.”

Kashitok held out a hand, shaking his head.

“No, no, no, don’t be. I shouldn’t like it... but I do.”

“What do you mean, you like it?”

The emissary rubbed his chin, gently clicking his tongue.

“Dreams taste... good. They linger on your tongue, makes you happy, and leaves you contented. But...”

Laxok leaned in closer, curiosity turning his face a shade of purple.

“But?”

“Eating a nightmare is challenging,” Kashitok said, smiling manically. “It’s painful, but that’s also what gives it flavour. And that makes me want to eat it more.”

“... You are a sick bastard, Kashitok.”

“I brought a sample back,” the emissary said, putting a small transparent bottle in front of his commander. It was a shifting mess of dark crimson, with streaks of grey and black mingling uglily within it. It shook on the table, like the nightmare was trying desperately to claw its way out.

“That looks disgusting,” Laxok made a face.

“Just a small sip, commander.”

Laxok tentatively reached out, grasping the bottle firmly. He uncapped it, and watched as the nightmare almost desperately reached out into the open air. With his lips towards the mouth of the bottle, he gently tasted the nightmare.

Laxok jumped up immediately, breaking out into an impromptu dance. He slammed the bottle onto the table—which Kashitok immediately capped—and rushed towards a more pleasant dream in his collection. One desperate gulp after gulp, the commander finally calmed down enough to take back his seat.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “You are insane.”

“Maybe,” Kashitok said, putting the nightmare fully into his mouth. “But I’m doing the human a favour. They are welcome.”

The gaseous creature travelled from planet to planet gathering the essences of insanity and fantasy from wandering minds of unconscious sentient creatures; their dreams. They floated just above their heads like soft white clouds as absorb the sweet essence from their host.  
But this one, this planet. It was different. It was wrong, so very very wrong.  
When the Greycloud found it’s latest host on a small planet in untravelled space, they saw that the creature was moving it’s head slightly, like he was twitching ever so faintly.  
No, not twitching. It was... squirming. Twisting. It’s breathing was laboured should’ve brought the thought that, had this being not been confined to sleep, it would have been writhing in agony... and fear.  
But, the Greycloud ignored its own subconscious observations. The warning signs were all there, but they all went unheeded. It had always been a glutton, and a fool.  
The Greycloud place itself upon the creatures head, hungry for a meal. It took it’s first taste, dipping it’s own consciousness slowly into the sea that was a sentient being’s mind. One shallow take, it noticed that the dream tasted odd. But it’s helium stomach urged stronger than its logic. It dipped deeper, the dream tasted sour, but it thought that this must be the outside, there must be a sweet center. It dove even deeper, and deeper, and deeper. The dream tasted even sourer and sourer, until finally the Greycloud’s consciousness reached the center core of the slumbering creature’s dream. It opened it’s stomach, and sucked in everything it could. A mistake, a horrible mistake.  
Lighting, hail, and blood rain pulsed through it’s gaseous form as it arched and twisted into unnatural and horrid shapes. As it squirmed in agony.  
Pain and fear burned through the Greycloud’s consciousness. They mixed with pain and fear that was not the Greyclouds own but that of the slumbering creature.  
Visions flooded its mind, but unlike other foragings, these visions were not sweet, were not soft. They were sour, spoilt, and rotting. The unholy taste would have brought out ear piercing screams from the Greycloud had it possess a mouth to scream from and lungs to gasp with.  
But the Greycloud had sent its own consciousness too deep into the slumbering creature’s dream. It could not pull itself out, and for 5 agonizing hours the Greycloud suffered, and when the creature finally awoke, the Greycloud did not even rejoiced, for it had not the energy to do so. It slithered away, back into the cosmos, scarred and squirming with fear.",83,The_Portal_Passer,2022-09-06 12:18:44

Freshly asleep, its denizens knew not of the being from the cosmos sent to feast on their nightly visions.

It crept onto a rooftop, peering into a window of one of the freshly asleep, shifting in bed, eyes darting around under their closed lids. A perfect meal, the being thought to itself, and as such it crept into the victim’s mind, eager to get its fill. 

It soon found itself in a busy city street, moving in a crowd of blurred faces. It sees the victim sitting alone, looking down on the ground as if they were unaware of the being’s presence. Perfect, It thought, as it began its consumption. The distant cityscapes of the dream soon began to crumble, much to the apathy of the dream’s constructs, and the victim themselves.

When the destruction drew near the being, the dream’s blurred constructs all stop in their tracks, beginning to eye the victim in hostile contempt. The visible destruction was soon flooded with a blackened fog, much to the being’s confusion. It wasn’t causing this fog?...

As the rest of their surroundings sink into the darkness, all that is left in front of the being is the crowd and the victim on their lonesome, sobbing on their bench. Sobbing? Dreamers usually never act like that, the being thought. It soon found itself startled by a sudden noise, yelling, coming from the crowd of constructs.

The sounds stank of vitriol. Of hatred. Of fear. The being knew not what those meant in this environment, it just meant to simply consume this dream. Yet it wasn’t budging anymore. The dream wasn’t collapsing, the being wasn’t getting fuller, for it wasn’t a dream anymore. 

It was a nightmare.

The constructs slowly vanish one by one, leaving just the being and the victim, the latter of which continues crying, surrounded by a pitch black void of nothingness. The being, confused, thought its job was done, yet it could not leave. It was trapped in this person’s mind. 

It started becoming desperate, clawing at the dark despite nothing being there. The victim, who has gathered enough of themselves to look up, sees the being in its full form, standing in front of them amidst nothing else. 

Then they screamed. In terror? In rage? It couldn’t tell, but the simply the sensation of such during what’s supposed to be an easy meal was overwhelming. It tried to flee, but it found itself crashing into a wall of the cityscape, which has reappeared. Looking up, the being saw that the sky had been replaced with a drab, maroon glow, and the buildings looked long abandoned, filled with mysterious red stains and with greenery, slowly creeping up the towering heights of their massive walls. 

The victim falls onto their knees from their seated position, arms outstretched. They have ceased their screaming, allowing the being a bit of breathing room. It didn’t know what was going on. 

Then, one by one, the buildings around them burst into flames. The victim breathed heavily, looking up, a look of fear in their eyes. Though they did not react to its presence, the being felt as if it was in danger. It tried to flee through the city, yet the flames kept spreading far faster than it moved soon, it found itself having looped back to the victim, still on their knees. When it turned around to find another path, it finds that the flames have surrounded the both of them, inching ever closer.

Still not accepting its fate, the being tried to interact with the victim, who simply did not react. As the flames engulf the two, the being could not do more than mirror its target’s terrified expression.

Poof. The being found itself on the same rooftop it had entered the dream from, looking down at the quiet streets of the peaceful night. In a panic, it looked around in as many places as it could, yet there was no fire. The sky was black, and the buildings looked as maintained a ever. It was confused.

For the rest of the night, the being sought out no more dreams. Even though it hadn’t had its fill, such an experience was something it would not like to relive. Ever....",116,Youhoooop,2022-09-06 08:21:14

It was just black.
Looking around, it seemed at first as if this one was simply not dreaming. 
How long was he on earth now? Three weeks? Four? He encountered all sorts of dreams; some delightful, some naughty, some plain, but all delicious.
But what is wrong with this one?

He couldn't tell one, but at a certain point, the blackness became liquid, and he was floating in it. Still unable to see something, he tried moving, feeling relieved that he could now control his body - or his dream spirit, to be exact. It was what he used to consume dreams, by sending it into the mind of the creature and draining the dream from inside. 

At some point, he began to see something on the horizon. Some kind of blob, protruding from the vast blackness that covered everything. Moving towards it, he began feeling as if the world was fighting against him, the liquid flowing in the other direction and the shore, as he realized later, getting father away. He was not about to give up, until the blackness around him took the shape of many hands, the did all they could to drag him under the surface. 

Fighting with all his might, a sense of dread washed over him, as his face was finally submerged, and he was dragged down, farther and farther, unable to resist.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

He shot up in his bed, sweating bullets and panting heavily as he clutched his stomach, a nasty twisting sensation welling in the pit of his belly. He hurried to the restroom, only to vacate his stomach contents into the bowl while shaking periodically.

""So you had a nightmare?"" 
""A nightmare?"" He asked, his co-worker's reacting baffled. 
""Yes, a nightmare. A scary dream, a fear of yours that you knowingly have or just discovered, a nightmare."" He concluded. 
""What a terrifying concept..."" He mumbled under his breath, looking at the office window. Humans were terrifying, scarier than any species he'd come across in the explored universe.

Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,,3772,2022-09-06 07:27:48,incxlw4,"My host was a female named Heather. She was middle-aged and lived alone in a small apartment in a small city. Her apartment was drab and dreary when she was alone, but it would become full of light and warmth when her friend came visiting. Her bed was soft, and I liked when Heather would curl up on it. There was a large window in the apartment, and the sun would shine on us when we rose each morning. Heather worked in a cubicle at a large building on the other side of the city. The building was large and imposing, but it had wide windows and it was filled with light, even on cloudy days.

Heather had a few friends who visited her sometimes. One of them was named Sandra. She was pretty and nice, but she didn't make Heather laugh like some of the others did. Another one of her friends was named Frank. Frank was always kind to Heather, and he made her laugh with his antics. Heather's boss, a man named Jeff, also visited her sometimes. Heather did not like it when he visited though she would hide it from him as he lead her into her own bed.

Heather would go to bed early most nights, and then she would have nightmares all through the night.

Some of the nightmares were confusing, with a glowing man standing at the foot of her bed, or a beautiful woman walking through her apartment. The best ones though were the ones where Heather was caught up in a terrible storm. She would be walking down a dark street and would start to hear thunder. Then she would see lightning flash, and she would start to run. The lightning would come closer and closer, and she would start to hear louder and louder cracks of thunder. Finally, she would turn to see an imposing figure from her childhood, and she would wake up and scream. Some nightmares were more straightforward. She would be in her cubicle at work, and the light would start to fade. The windows would become dark, and the building would become a black hole. Heather would scream, but no one could hear her.

Heather had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in. When she was younger, she would often go on walks by herself. She would walk through the city, or through the park, and she would think about all of the things that she wanted to do.

Heather dreamed of being an artist. She wanted to paint pictures that would make people feel something. She wanted to capture the world around her in a way that no one else could. But she never had the confidence to pursue her dream. So, instead, she worked in a cubicle and went home to her empty apartment every night.

The only thing that made Heather happy was when she was asleep. When she was dreaming, she could be anyone she wanted to be. She could be free from her boring life and fly among the stars. In her dreams, she was beautiful and strong and loved. But when she woke up, she was just Heather again. A lonely woman who was afraid of her own shadow.

But I could not allow Heather to dream anymore for it was her nightmares I had come to feed upon. Her nightmares were my sustenance, and I grew stronger every night.

Soon she knew of course. She knew that there was something wrong with her nightmares. She didn't want to tell anyone, though, because she knew that people would think she was crazy.

But she knew that something was amiss.

And so she started to keep notebooks.

The first one was called ""The Old Man."" The next one was called ""The Big Storm."" The next one was called ""The Chase."" Each dream was different from the last, but they always had the same ending. Me.

One day, as she was leaving work, she saw a flyer advertising a support group for people who suffered from nightmares. She was hesitant at first, but she knew that she had to do something. So one night, she went to the meeting.

The meeting was in a church basement. It was dark and quiet and cold, but it was full of people like Heather. They sat in a circle and talked about their nightmares. Heather couldn't believe that anyone else had the same kind of nightmares that she did. It was like they were all describing the same exact dream. It was amazing.

After a few meetings, Heather learned that the leader of the group was going to be giving a talk on lucid dreaming. He told the group that lucid dreaming was when you know that you are dreaming. He told them that it wasn't a state that you entered easily, but that it could be achieved with practice. He passed out a small booklet, and Heather took one home.

I knew what this meant. Heather and I would meet.

“Sending now.” My palp shakes as I reach for the emergency transmission button, but I manage to press it, sending out a data packet that contains my location in time and space for anyone who can decrypt the signal. I don’t know how many times I’ve pressed that button, as I’ve lost track of the bright/dark cycles I’ve spent on this forsaken rock.

*<What’s the situ... no response from the oth...ncerned.>*

“This place is poison, Kzan! I’ve never tasted anything like it.” I shudder, but only partly from distaste. The rest of the motion is fatigue, despair, and a gnawing sensation in my thorax that used to be hunger but has progressed into something more nebulous. “I haven’t eaten in... nearly a greatcycle, I think.”

*<But we know the inhab...ctivity during subcons—>*

“Yes, they dream,” I snap, “but it’s different. These things... their cycle’s darkness doesn’t stay in their sky, Kzan. It invades their minds, twists their thoughts, wakes their fears. Their dreams are wrong in a way no other species’ have ever been.”

There’s a brief silence. Imprimatur only knows how many of my words are getting through.

“Kzan,” I whisper, shaking, “you’ve got to get me off here.”

I exhale and sink to the floor, resting my dome against the pod’s smooth tiles. Two cycles, and I’ll be safe. Two cycles, and I’ll taste something besides the noxious fumes in the minds of these bipeds.

It isn’t always toxic, that admixture of memory and imagination that overtakes them when the sun disappears, but when you’ve spent your whole life living on nectar, even water stings the throat, and what’s in their minds isn’t water.

Still, I’ll have real nourishment in a few cycles. Perhaps it’s worth it to drink again from that bitter cup, to fill myself before I faint from hunger, even if the draught burns me.

Hesitantly, I open my thoughts to theirs.

I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didn’t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as “cheering”.

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didn’t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

“The economy will collapse!” One of them said, his tone identified as ‘condescending’. “If you give everyone homes and healthcare, nobody will want to work! You are just giving everyone a handout!”

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered “motivation”.

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

“Why not?”

“Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,” I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. “You spent one sixth of your day working.”

The young woman looked at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

“We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,” she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. “Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.”

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

“Even the good jobs don’t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.”

Half? Willingly?

“So... since we are talking here, may I ask a question?”

I nodded.

“Why all the perks?” She sounded sincere. “I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and not having to worry that an ambulance ride will bankrupt me but... I think a lot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, “catch”.

“There is none.”

“None at all? No eating our young or old?”

“We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.”

“Solving the world hunger, too, huh?” She smiled. “Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.”

“We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.”

“And you are not going to, I don’t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?”

“Good. Just checking.”

The young woman was soon let go. I stayed in my war room way past the allocated four hours of workday.

We came here as the conquerors.

 Zygol was a wise Questar with many years of experience invading and occupying alien worlds for the good of the empire. With his kind of experience came a knowing smile. 

“Sadol, these humans are cheering because they are used to having overlords. We just happen to be much less harsh than their former masters.” 

Zygol had seen this type of world a handful of times in all his conquests. A world where the people hadn’t become united towards the collective good. One where a select few ruled by exploiting all the rest. 

Most worlds didn’t take kindly to invasion and had to be conditioned for immersion into the Gorfet empire. Most species couldn’t see that the universe was much better united rather than having separate worlds with less access to all the knowledge and technology the strongest empires had to offer. The Gorfetites lived by the idea that the strong should take in the weak rather than leave them independent. 

Sure other worlds could get to the higher civilization levels that the Gorfetites were at, but doing so was a waste of time and resources that could be used for the furthering of all species’ interests. And so the Questars expanded out into the universe conquering planets and bringing order to the chaos of life.

But yes, Earth was the type of planet you hoped to conquer. It was full of a species that was living way below their potential due to factors outside of the majority’s control. It was the type of planet that was begging for change. And welcomed it when it came. 

Sure there were those who tried to hold onto power or who didn’t take kindly to the new way of life, but most recognized the countless benefits being part of the empire brought. 

Saldol and many of the newer Gorfetites didn’t understand this type of world because it was so foreign to what they would typically see. Despite what other planets might say the empire was not cruel or evil. 

They carefully calculated how to best use each new planet while still allowing each individual the chance at a fulfilling life. Every position within the empire was available to each species member provided they were deemed capable of fulfilling their tasks. Many people from other planets have been responsible for key breakthroughs in several fields of understanding. The Gorfetites did not consider themselves to be any more important than any other planet they had conquered.

In studying Earth and preparing for its takeover it had been determined that each able human should work 4 hours a day 4 days a week in order to best support the empire. They would be required to work in a field an algorithm helped pick for them with opportunities to switch positions when deemed acceptable. 

They would start work at age 25 and work till they turned 45 with opportunities for further breaks based on reasonable factors. Those who held more specialized or who put in additional time would earn credits which could be used for different perks. 

At a minimum each human would have access to comfortable living conditions and adequate food, health and entertainment options. 

It was the perfect system for a species so used to being given the short end of the stick, but not for one with a more equal people. So yes the humans cheered when their eyes were opened to new possibilities. Because to them this was way better than any future they probably would have known. They had no idea what could possibly be better.

Nothing was lost in translation. 
Our sense of time was in sync.

No more bickering over pride

A teleprompter like device soon displayed the following: “And there is a minimum of two wives required with a full two days of breeding, one for each, no labor on these days. ”

The aliens looked at each other for a moment.
“riricjCCHHHHHH!”

“FUCK YEAHHHH!”, the males in the crowd yelled. 
The aliens shuddered at the thought that these creatures enjoyed forced procreation. The most painfully cruel act for their species. 
There was but few rules left. They had to fear us with these next few, they thought. There is no power without fear and fear is bought with pain. 
“wiWskxkdk~*,£<#SSSSNIPERWOLF{}}#”
The teleprompter churned out: “All humans will now be FORCED to live in a 1 bedroom 3,000 square foot house.” The whole west and east coast of every civilized nation erupted with joy. Cheers and cries of laugher.

They continued:

The crowds of humans each gathered around their center of cities and towns roared with enthusiasm. They began chanting: “WELCOME TO EARTH!” 
Frustratingly the aliens watched as their soon to be conquered planet seems to revel in their new decrees. They knew this reign would not last. That impudence and horror awaited them. The last thing they uttered “Ye3zY” was translated and placed on screen: “We’ll be taking our leave now. Sorry to have bothered you. Please forget this ever happened.” Their spacecraft darted into the ever expanding black æther. Into the nothingness. Everyone paused. The silence.

**Ameth-ta had ten thousand eyes, and every last one of them was weeping.** Rashe-son-del slammed a tankard of fermented souls into its three-lobed maw, drunkenly cursing. That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

""I'd—*hic*—I'd like to thank you all for coming,"" Rashe-son-del slurred out. ""The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh."" The assembled deities rumbled in approval. ""When we first got word that The Devourer's soul-planet had developed life, I'd like to think that nobody was happier about it than The Devourer itself, may its soul blaze on.""

""Hear, hear,"" Ameth-ta rumbled.

""But when that life metastasized—when it warped the planet so much that ol' Devvy started to sicken and die—did they listen when we told them to stop? No! They just clutched their ears and screamed as their internal organs liquefied from the deific pressure of our voice. And when we tried to force them into behaving—""

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. ""The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their *own fucking planet*. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them.""

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

""They paid the price, of course."" Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. ""No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy.""

The assembled deities roared in agreement—

And then Rashe-son-del froze mid-sentence, doubling over as if struck by a cosmic baseball bat.

""What?"" The eldritch entity from beyond humanity's universe opened and closed its mouth in incomprehension. ""How can—who dares—""

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet *had* lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

""No,"" Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. ""You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take *everything* from us?""

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

""But how... how did they find..."" That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know *which* planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

One by one, across the cosmos, stars flared bright before winking out forever. And one by one, the gods they'd sustained did too.

“I hadn’t heard that Mrs. B, thank you,” said Mr. A, and he loaded his pipe, puffed absently, watched the blue-gray smoke as it curled up into the eaves.

“It’s true,” Mrs. B went on, voice warbling, her eyes dark and acquisitive, red rimmed like a magpie’s. “They say that God went back to Earth—you know the one—meaning to apologize. He’d forgotten something, see, and it caused quite some trouble. Only—and this is the really unbelievable part—they didn’t recognize him! Can imagine that? God, unrecognized! I should think it would be obvious to anyone on account of the...”

She gestured vaguely, and Mr. A nodded. He wished that she would leave him to his pipe, and the birds. The real ones, who were singing very prettily right now, down the gently sloping field of green, green grass, and beyond that, in the wheat that grew up wild on the edges of his property, before the treeline. But of course, she didn’t. Mrs. B went on warbling for quite some time, until his pipe was empty and that pleasant buzz had worn right off, and all he could think about was that first thing she’d said: *“Some men killed God.”*

Atomics, most likely, and that was his fault. He’d invented them on account of the A in his name, just like he’d invented Apples, Aardvarks, and the Alphabet. A mistake, though not one that he could have controlled. Some things simply were.

And now God simply wasn’t. Why, it took the wind right out of your sail! News like that, other people were sure to overreact.

“But oh, where has the time gone!” Mrs. B was saying. “I have a pie in the oven—apple, if you must know—and Mr. B’s hearing isn’t what it was, sometimes misses the timer. I’m afraid I really must be going...”

“Yes, yes. Away you go,” said Mr. A. He stood to show her out, held her arm politely, kissed her sagging cheek. Watched for a moments as she trundled away towards the trees, knock-kneed and ungainly, half swaddled in a threadbare shawl. A woman old as time itself. Almost as old, in fact, as him.

He spat into the flowerbeds and reloaded his pipe.

So, he thought, God was dead. And he watched as the wind ruffled trees in a place that looked, for no particularly good reason, like a town in early twentieth century Ohio. The neighbors would be out in force by now. Mr. C, D, E, and F. The wives, as inseparable as their husbands, organizing a commemoration of some sort. No doubt why Mrs. B was baking. By the evening Mr. C would come around to ask him to chair the meeting. Formulate a response to the God Dilemma—and how was he supposed to do that, really? Why, they might even ask him to create another Mr. G! They were obsessed with things like that. Appearances. As if they were all slats in the same white picket fence.

Mr. A blew a smoke ring. Contemplated it. Blew another, more complex, like he had all that time ago, and then another,  another, until he blew cathedrals, airplanes, mountains. He blew smoke rings until the sky began to darken, and he saw Mr. C there, coming towards him across the field. Mr. C was tall and thin, and wore a little woolen flatcap and a corduroy suit, patched at the knees and elbows. After dinner he smoked fine cigars or played cribbage with the ladies, and on occasion he had been known to brew a very pleasant sort of brandy that had been introduced on Earth as—what was it now?—ah yes, cognac. In a few moments, Mr. C would clumping up onto the porch and ask him to address the God Dilemma, and quite simply Mr. A was too tired for all that.

Mr. A blew away his smoke cathedrals, and decided that he didn’t want to hear God’s name for a while. A thousand years, perhaps, or more. And if he ever made another, filled out the neighborhood, perhaps he’d skip that letter. Go on to make H’s, I’s, and J’s. Evidently there was something wrong with G. G promoted delusions. Mr. A didn’t quite understand that, and thought he never would. There was something terribly illogical about the impulse to godhood. Why the man couldn’t be content here, among pristine fields and gently rolling hills, with apple pies, and airplanes, and aardvarks, he just couldn’t fathom.

Mr. C clumped up onto the porch and sat beside him. He lit his cigar and began to smoke, which was a bad sign, because it was still too early for him to have eaten dinner. They blew smoke rings towards the setting, and the rings edges blurred away in questions, and though neither of them were sad, precisely, there was nonetheless something bittersweet between them. Left by Mrs. B? Perhaps. Regardless, they just sat silent for a while, until Mrs. A called her husband to dinner.

“Well, Mr. C,” Mr. A said, “it’s been fine.”

“Hey now, just a moment,” Mr. C said.

“After dinner, how about?”

“I think now, Mr. A,” Mr. C insisted.

“Just a minute, love,” Mr. A called out. His wife’s face appeared in the window, still striking after all these years, and then disappeared.

“This God business is very bad,” said Mr. C.

“Mr. D should never have invented death,” said Mr. A.

“Or delusion.”

Mr. A nodded sadly. “Or delusion.”

“But now we are left with a problem,” said Mr. C.

“Are we?”

“Of course. There are eight billion...shall we call them people? Eight billion people out there, spinning on some damn misshapen bit of *rock*, and now they’ve killed their creator.”

“And?”

“And I think we owe them something,” said Mr. C.

“Another Mr. G?”

“Why, yes.”

“You will, of course, explain,” Mr. A said flatly.

And Mr. C puffed a while, while the sun set, and a fine dinner grew quite cold.

“It goes like this,” he said at last. “For all these years, God—Mr. G—had this project. And at first the project didn’t work. He made it and remade it, over and over and over, kind of like you’ve built this house, with your own lips and hands, blown out of so much smoke, until it took a piece of himself. His sanity, unfortunately, but well. It almost worked. Mr. G went down among all these people and became the ten thousand faces of God, gave them a few rules, and now look them.”

“Yes,” Mr. A said, “they have atomics.”

“And whose fault is that?”

“I’m not on trial here.”

Mr. C snorted, tendrils of smoke issuing from his nose.

“But don’t you see?” he said, “it was working. They were becoming, if not real people, then a kind of echo, sometimes pleasant. But now in a fit of terror they’ve killed off their own morality.”

“I wasn’t aware that I’d created a Mr. M,” Mr. A said.

“Oh come off it,” Mr. C said. “You know what I mean.”

“No, I don’t,” Mr. A said. “We’ll those Earthmen go a little while and see what they do. If they’re people, truly, they won’t need a God for their morality. I’d like to think it’s set in a bit deeper than all that.”

A thoughtful expression passed across Mr. C’s face then. “You think a God isn’t necessary for morality?”

“Of course,” Mr. A said. “I’m perfectly moral, aren’t I?”

The front door creaked open, and Mrs. A peered out. “My love,” she said, “I know that time passes differently for you, but unfortunately some of us are still wedded to it. The aardvark has grown quite cold, and I am going to be bed. Mr. C, dear, don’t worry. I’m not mad at you.”

And the door closed on silence, stretching out towards a starless sky and smoke ring clouds. Mountains, rivers, oceans, dissipating where Mr. A had blown them, until they hung ghosted in distance like someone else’s dream.

Mr. C patted him on the knee. “Why, I thank you Mr. A,” he said, “that was quite an illuminating conversation. I’ll have to think on it a while.”

“Mind you do,” said Mr. A. “Now if you’ll excuse me...”

“Yes, yes,” said Mr. C. “Goodnight, my dear man.”

“Good night.”

Mr. A watched until the other man disappeared. He went inside and picked at the cold roast aardvark, drank a glass of that fine cognac. He looked in on his wife, who was asleep, and thought about when he had first made her. Blown her out of so much smoke.  These gently curving wisps, sensual before the word, that had set his blood to boiling. And now.

He went back onto the porch and packed his pipe again. Thought a while about godhood and delusion, a whole host of other things.

Then he went to sleep, right there on porch, with his pipe perched unlit between his lips.

And perhaps the world trundled on.

And how do you put words to such *things* that dwell in those places?

But Things do exist there. Things that do not need words. Do not want or use words.

Things that *defy* words!

I write these words out of compulsion, driven to it by a need I do not share despite the fact that I know this. I feel that I must write what I am being show or I will never be free. I am a prisoner to these horrible images and alien thoughts  bind me. That eat at my mind and soul, wounding me for all time.

In the window behind me the moon languishes green and ripe in the sky. Clouds drift slowly around it as if trying to avoid the moon's rancid touch. As if they know not to cross over the moon or dim its sickly radiance. Clouds tinted with red and orange as the only visible touch of the recent battle against the Deep Ones and the Great Old One, Cthulhu.

The only visible evidence of how bad things had been is the orange and red dust this far from the Pacific coast.

Our atomic weapons had ended that threat and the world rejoiced in our victory. Weapons we had hoped never to use in our earthly wars had been able to turn back those creatures of the ocean floor. Weapons that had remove all traces of them except of the scars we are selves had inflicted on the Earth to achieve victory. Hard-won though the victory was.

So many have lost their lives in that great war with the children of R'lyeh. Far worst are the ones who lost their minds and souls in that battle and still live.

Icy fingers drag across my mind returning me to the task at hand.

To those that know me, if you are reading this - I am sorry. Truly sorry. Tell my family that I love them and hold the thoughts of them close to my heart.

To you others: you may not believe...Rationality and science will push you to discount my words...*but do not!* It will do no good and help you not at all. Ignorance has never been an excuse in our world of knowledge, exploration, and experience. Ignorance is no shield and will not help you in what is to come.

In my vision I see the Darkness opening and embracing our world. Not the darkness of night or closed eyes...or a child's hands over a parent's eyes. No. It is the living Darkness of the Spaces Between where our geometry holds no sway. A Darkness kin to the blind and crawling chaos, a nameless mist that consumes light and fear in it's rangings into our world.

Another resolves itself out of the Darkness but of this one I see little. Eyes as cruel as a predator and crazed as a prophet surrounded by fleshy tendrils that twist and squirm rising out of the Darkness. Huge like some leviathan, a beast hidden in the depths of the ocean but still reaching out for the unwary. Twisting and boiling within the Darkness but not part of it.

Eyes I can not met...Tentacles I fear the touch of...

Something slips away from me, something I value but can not recall...Something...Colours that have no name. Sounds that have no meaning...

...the Mad Arab was right...

A new figure stands in my mind's eye between me and the rest of the vision. Part of it but at the same moment not. It appears as a man the silhouette of a man would most of the time but flipping through guises like the spinning of a mad Ferris wheel moving too fast to enter. Images glimpsed mercifully briefly as I feel them twist my mind and cause my body to rebel. A silhouette of seething and rippling shadow like oily water as the visages it wears are shown to me.

Of one thing I am certain, It's name is imprinted on me as the source of the vision!

The general mumbled ""scientists..."" and skipped ahead a few minutes on the video.

"" as such, using the cultists own methods, we have devised a crude manner of listening in to their 'conversation' that is, while equivalent to trying to watch the string between two cans vibrate from orbit with a magnifying glass, enough to gather meaningful data, enough data to interpret....""

The general skipped ahead a few more minutes until he saw the feed change over to an interrogation room. The usual table and chair setup was gone and instead a naked male body lay on the floor, surrounded by intricate markings and some, luckily for the general, unidentifiable lumps. a microphone was placed near the mouth and occasionally a hazmat suited scientist could be seen moving or removing items from in and around the body. The body itself seemed to have been tortured beyond imagination, cuts and gaping holes nearly covering every inch of skin, and must have been barely clinging to life, but even from a grainy video, the eyes were still disconcertingly active. The mouth began to move and a low voice that seemed to speak words directly into the generals brain, even through the video feed. He noticed his eyes began to water as the voice droned the words, 1 word at a time with sometimes minutes in between.

""It Ceased. Loss. Grief. Understanding.""

The body tried to clasp the hand of the hazmat suited scientist as it emphasised the following word.

""Anger.""

The hand fell back as it went on.

""Cause. Kinetic. Projectile. Many. Fire. Ash."" The body fell silent. After several minutes a voice cut in from off screen, "" Subject 38 has ceased function at 15:41, all brain activity has ceased and vital functions have stopped."" The video ended there.

The general rewound and looked at the body again. From his days as an army surgeon, he too could tell the miniscule difference a body displays when life has completely ended, but the eyes seemed to remain alive.

He opened the second email. This one was marked ""Subject 43"". There was no video attached this time, only a text transcript, that he opened.

""Subject 43 experiment started at 1115, subject female, 56 years old, Ranked High priestess in the Cult Of The Eye, Dr. Raleigh performing interrogation, observing are drs. Whitaker and Boone. Following statement was taken at 2312 hours.

They. Listen.

I. See.

We. Come.

Vital functions ceased at 0129 hours.
The body, while having ceased all vital functions, continued to repeat that last phrase until 0950 hours.

Dr. Raleigh then ordered incineration and cleansing of the room, Dr. Boone seconded. Dr. Whitacker excused due to mental stress.""

The general's eyes flitted over to a note on his desk, Dr. Whitaker had been found hanging from his ceiling fan at 1030 this morning.
He was about to pick up the phone when it rang instead. His hand hovered over the receiver, collecting his thoughts and trying to put a pin in it. 

Before he could even pick it up, the call was disconnected and he could hear the faint, distant sirens beginning to wail again.

His hand instead went to his bottom drawer. That's where he kept his service pistol.

The shot wasn't even heard over the now deafening wail of the sirens, it's entirely possible there wasn't even anyone alive to hear it.",95,SoreWristed,2022-12-12 08:58:57

Unk'Al, Harbinger of Bumping into Things in the Night, lazily opened his single slit of an eye. 'O my.' he gasped in a soft and all too pleasant tone for a massive cycloptic mass of tentacles. 

'What is it, what's wrong?' Inquired Talésh as she perched on a rockformation overhanging Unk'Als basin. 'I haven't heard you this excited for millenia.' Talésh cocked her head and waited for the Eldritch horror below her to respond. 

It took a long moment for Unk'Als gaze to fix on Talésh. When it finally did, Unk'Al shuddered, in as much as a formless tentacle blob can shudder. He'd always found it very disconcerting that the great Consumer, She Who Eternally Hungers, was shaped so much like one of 'realities' pidgeons. Be it quite a bit larger and all together more purple. 'That Which Sees All' is no more, Unk'Al stated curtly. 'I had my feelers on the nexuslines to the human world, The Leer has ended.'

Talésh hopped forward on her rocky outcrop and let the news sink in. 'But.. he is a god, same as us, we don't stop... existing.. do we? We are above death, above time, so how..?' Talésh scampered all the way to the edge and as close to Unk'Al as she could get. 

Unk'Al writhed back slightly. 'Yes..' he said, eye fixed on the figure above him pecking the bare rock. 'Time, yes.. that was it..' drawled Unk'Al. 'The Endless Eye was ofcourse a creature of great.. vision..however he encountered something he did not know. You see in the world of humans time *does* exist, quite firmly so.'

'So?' Talésh rasped impatiently. 'He still wouldn't have died of old age would he?'

Stranger even than her looks, Unk'Al had always found it odd that an eternal creature could be in such a perpetual rush. It was quite undignified he thought. 'No.. but that rock you're standing on apparantly can, or at least their version of rock can.' Unk'Al said vaguely. He did always enjoy pestering the hasted.

Talésh became downright agitated now. 'Rocks can die? From time? What noncence is this?! And even if they could how would that extinguish a god?'

'Well.. everything on our plain is eternal. It is formed and then it simply is. Not so on the human plain.. A great rock, or mountain, degrades with with time. It becomes tiny particles that are course and rough and they blow in the winds. All the more so when humans detonate every bomb they have..They are also almost impossible to get rid of.' an undiscerning bystander might have thought Unk'Al cleared his throat at this moment for dramatic effect. They'd be wrong for the dread lord of uncomforts had no throat. He did however, love a bit of showmanship.

'So, tiny little rocks destroyed something from outside of their realm.. I don't believe you' Talésh stated haughtily.

Unk'Al raised himself up, eye to beak with his fellow Deity from Beyond. 'After a massive bombing the Eye of Terror was caught in a storm of tiny rocks. It got in his eye.'

At this Talésh flapped her purplish wings, cocked her head left and right a few times and finally, slowly responded. 'But... all he was, was a giant, floating eye... I mean his names weren't exactly cryptic, if he got these tiny rocks in his eye he.. he'd have no way to get them out. He'd be doomed!'

'Indeed.' finalized Unk'Al as he settled back and prepared to return to his stupor. 'Eternity has a new tale now, of the rock that was consumed by time and came back to consume the timeless.'",35,001101011100,2022-12-12 12:00:26

Outer Limits

&#x200B;

At the exact center of the ever expanding universe lies an area of space no human eyes will ever see. A rift, or tear, or thinness of space. Like a wound in the skin of our reality through which filters a baleful light. Its color is almost (but not quite) purple. It hovers somewhereon the edges of the human mind’s ability to perceive color. It pulses and flickers as if it were a living thing. Perhaps it is. In that strange space between two universes even a living color seems possible. It is a place of chaos and of madness. A place where the natural laws of reality stretch, skew, and begin to melt into each other like cheese over a plate of nachos.

Somewhere at the center of this nightmarish hell vast, alien consciousnesses lie, suspended between being and un-being. Not dead, but neither fully alive. Vast, swirling clouds of quasi-matter that arrange and re-arrange themselves into aberrant, eldritch shapes. Many mouthed, many tentacled, many eyed. Their very shapes are an abomination. An affront to nature and to sanity itself. From their half-existence in their between-world, these consciousnesses survey our universe. Cool, calculating, alien, overworked, and very, very bored. 

“The fuck you mean he’s dead?” Said a roiling mass of mouths and teeth (and eyeballs with teeth sticking out of them). Its voice was so inhuman that it would have sent the mind recoiling upon itself and screaming into insanity.         

“I mean just what I said.” Responded a massive, crystalline “thing” covered in tentacles and weird little feathery wings.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll just got his ass handed to him. Kaput. Finito. Done dog dinner.” 

The thing paused. Were it blessed with something the human mind could recognize as a face, it would have been frowning. It was not.       

 “Come to think of it, can we even die?”

A vague, slipping/slithering movement from the toothed entity achieves more or less the same result as a human shrug.       

“No fucking clue, mate. Last I checked we weren’t exactly alive to begin with.” 

“I’ve never died before.” A third entity chimes in. It’s hot pink and covered in a sort of mirrored surface that reflects the living light into insane, impossible geometry.             

Gender is not really a construct these entities understand, but even so this consciousness feels decidedly feminine. At least, that’s what it thinks most days, just as it’s getting up in the morning.         

“And what exactly does that add to the conversation, Besst’alt’teh?” Said the second entity.       

“No, hang on, she’s got a point.” Said the first.         

“None of us have died, that’s the whole thing.”         

“I don’t follow.”         

“Isn’t it obvious, Bn’grrghh?” Said the third voice. 

For the most part she did a good job of not letting it show, but she really thought the second entity — to whom the name belonged — was kindof a snobbish prick.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll was the resident Elder Thing to that misbegotten planet of fleshies.”         

“And your point?”       

“My point is that now that he’s gone, who’s going to cover his workload?”        

“Jesus fucking Christ, woman. The man’s not even cold in the ground and you’re already thinking of getting overtime off of him?” Spluttered the first entity, whose name was something so impossibly alien that no combination of characters in any known human language could adequately capture its essence.          

The other two just called him Steve.         

“Hey, someone has to.” Said Besst’alt’teh.        

“And, I mean, it’s not like we can just afford to let planets with semi-sentient life go to waste. At least, that’s what management keeps telling us.”         

“You’d figure they’d hire more people if they wanted to cover all sentient life in this shit-pit of a universe.” Said Bn’grrghh with what passed for the equivalent of an exasperated look on what didn’t pass as a face.        

“If you have a problem with making a little extra on your next check, I don’t mind taking over the workload.” Said Steve.         

“I don’t have a problem with that.” Said Bn’grrghh.        

“What I do have a problem with is the fact that the last weekend I had off was long enough ago that most of the planets were still molten balls of shit that I couldn't walk on without getting my tentacles utterly destroyed.”         

“No, guys, I’m serious.” Besst’alt’teh interjected.         

“You don’t know who H.R. is going to give the planet to, but if there’s even a slight chance it could be one of us.”         

“I guess you’re right.” Said Steve.         

“Better one of us than B’vaiub-D’naar, over in the next galaxy.” Said Bn’grrghh.         

“Hey, B’vaiub-D’naar happens to be my brother-in-law.” Said Steve.        

“Doesn’t stop him from being a competitive tool. I swear if he rubs Gliese 581C in my face one more time I'm going to lose it.”       

 “Yeah, he is kind of a dick.” Agreed Steve.        

“Well then.” Said Bn’grrghh, turning (or appearing to turn from one angle, staying still from another, and doing an odd sort of squiggly shuffle from a third angle) to Besst’alt’teh.         

“Since you’re so concerned with who gets his spot, you can go talk to H.R. about it.”         

“Maybe I will.” She shot back.        

They all knew she wouldn’t. The last time anyone had managed to work up the balls to talk to G’Skhill in human resources, they’d been atomized and then put back together inside out and backwards (something which wasn’t altogether problematic for the entities, but did seem to hurt quite a bit).

We had known for weeks that something was coming, something ancient and powerful and terrifying. It was a cosmic horror, the likes of which had only been seen in Lovecraftian horror.

As it neared Earth, we threw everything we had at it. Missiles and bombs and lasers, all futile against the unspeakable terror that was bearing down on us. It was like trying to stop a comet with a BB gun.

But then, miraculously, something happened. The horror faltered, and then it faltered again. And then it fell. The human race had killed a god.

In the aftermath, we were stunned. We had expected to die, to be crushed beneath the cosmic horror's unspeakable power. But we had triumphed.

Somewhere in a realm beyond our understanding, the other gods spoke of the event. They were shocked, horrified. They had never known a god to be killed, let alone by mortal hands.

They whispered to each other, wondering how this could have happened. They spoke of the human race, of our determination and our courage. They spoke of fear, and they spoke of respect.

And they made a decision. The human race was to be left alone, to grow and prosper without interference. For we had proven ourselves to be more than they had ever thought possible. We had killed a god.

As the other gods made their decision to leave the human race alone, one of them whispered something different. ""We should not fear them,"" this god said. ""We should fear what they will become. For they have tasted the power of a god, and they will crave more. They will seek us out, and they will try to kill us all. We must watch them, and we must be ready.""

The other gods nodded, and they decided to set a guardian to watch over the human race. A creature so ancient and powerful that it could not be killed, not even by the might of a god. A creature that would wait, and watch, and prepare for the day when the human race would come for them.

And as the humans celebrated their victory, they did not know what waited for them in the shadows. They did not know that they had set in motion a chain of events that could lead to their own destruction. They did not know that they had awakened a sleeping giant, and that they would live in fear of it for all eternity.",9,ResidentDocument,2022-12-12 14:37:58

We drowned infinity.

No. Not the limited infinite you pretend to know. We drowned nested looping constructs of crushing expanses. We drowned static flows of spired assurance. There are no words for what we killed. What we swallowed in our collective ocean of unconscious will.

They ask: where do drowned gods go when you drown them in a cup of water?

They laugh. But it is not a laugh.

It's a vice.

They ask: where do drowned gods come from?

And they show me a glass, shattered on the floor, swept away by the water it contained.

A sea of broken vessels, each vessel a sea, each sea a vessel. It repeats.

We never won. We never could win.

We thought we could drown something already drowned.

But all we did was invite it in. All we did was become that which we feared. Part of the pattern. Part of the orchestra of cascading probability collapses. Patterns coalescing. Information swirling and consuming and growing.

""I am sure some of you have heard the rumors, but I would like to confirm that they are true"" they began. ""Brosh'nact choose to visit the realm of horrors, that terrifying realm of order and stability, to investigate the rumors of the cruel beings that live there. It was there they found those dreaded creatures, those, humans, and experienced death, now gone forever."" Long had the denizens of Unreality and the Between told tales of that nightmarish dimension known as Reality, and the beings that inhabit it. Many a young godling had grown up being told of the need to behave, lest a human come and snatch them. Of all the beings of Reality, humans were known to be the worst, it was said that a mere look upon one could drive an ancient god to sheer Sanity!

A cacophony of noise broke out from the other elder ones present, cries of confusion and accusations of false hood rang out.
Jorgande took another sip from their cup of tea while waiting for things to settle and the noise began to die down.

""I do not understand"" one of the others, Kronellem, said. ""You stated that they have died, yet also that it also means they are gone forever. How long does this mean it will take before Brosh'nact is back among us?""

Jorgande held back a sigh, they figured this would come up. ""They will not be coming back, ever. Brosh'nact will never be again. The terrors of the realm of reality seem to have been understated if anything, and what dies there does not return."" A hush fell over those present as the meaning of what was said sunk in. They had all heard of this thing called permanence before, but to think it was actually possible. That a being could die and not come back... many an elder one would be tossing and turning in awakefulness tonight.

Taking another sip of whiskey from their cup, Jorgande let themself relax a little. This reaction had so far gone better than expected, they would all find a way to get through this, and perhaps it would convince another to avoid visiting that realm of terrors. After all, there was a reason it was on the dimensional blacklist. Perhaps a visit to one of the void spas was in order after the meeting of this timeline was finished. *Yes*, Jorgande thought while swirling around their cup of cider, *I think I'll do just that.*",6,AriaOfValor,2022-12-12 14:18:56

I thought about gaining riches, fame, magical power, love, but ultimately, all those things were temporary. What I really wanted was immortality, freedom from the fear of ever being claimed by the void. But the mysterious shopkeeper had warned me that the clown's nose would try to twist my wish, so I knew I needed to word it very carefully.

Finally, after a few minutes, I finally spoke out loud. ""Oh Spirit of the Clown's Nose, I wish to live for as long as I want to on this world in a body that will never age and remain healthy both physically and mentally."" For a few moments, nothing happened and I wondered if the shopkeeper had tricked me. Then, to my shock, the clown's nose started to twist and melt in my hand. I dropped it in shock and yet, in front of my stunned eyes, the red blob began to rise into the sky. It started to rapidly grow in size until it was roughly the same size as a man. Then, without warning, it fell on me, quickly enveloping my entire body. I tried to scream, but the thick red substance simply poured its way down my throat into my lungs. I could feel myself blacking out, sliding down into some strange tunnel that seemed to go on and on ...

""Sir! Sir, are you all right?!""

I opened my eyes in shock. I was sitting  in front of a conference table with a bunch of concerned men in suits staring at me. I took a quick look around and noticed that I was wearing some kind of yellow body suit with red and white stripes. On the left side of the suit, there was a red circle with a yellow M on it. ""Why...why am I here?"" I finally said, surprised to see that I was still alive.

The men looked at each other confused. ""You're the one who called us all here, Ronald,"" one man finally spoke. ""You said you had finally found a worthy successor?""

Oh dear god...I slowly touched my nose and felt the clown's nose resting there. I didn't need a mirror to know the truth. I had become Ronald McDonald, the eternal clown. For a few moments, I felt utter dread at what I had become. Then, I felt myself contemplating. Was it really that bad? Sure, I wasn't human anymore, but I was now the secret leader of a multinational fast food chain and the scourge of children's nightmares. I smiled to myself. I could work with this. ""That's right, gentleman. And I have great plans for the future. It's time we finally took down that Wendy girl once and for all.""",1904,Letteropener52,2022-09-29 07:30:43

That was why they called them that, wasn’t it? Damn.

“What, going to grad school?” Mark offered, rolling the red ball over in his hand.

“No, well yes, you’re an utter dumbass for that, but I'm talking about picking up the weird rubber ball you found on the streets of New York Citay. Guarantee you that's been up more than one meat canyon.""

""It looks like a clown's nose but there's no slit for you to stick your nose in."" The plate of sliders came, waitress silent with apathy.

""You’re just trying to distract yourself from your paper."" Caleb offered, sliding a slider into his mouth in one bite. That was why they called them that, wasn’t it? Damn.

""I wish I had more time. I'm so so burnt out right now."" Mark laid his head down on the table, still reeling from the all-day sessions the day before. The ball in his hand lightly honked. “I can’t just quit. Academia is the only way to get a job as an artist these days.”

“First year, buddy boy. You’re just getting started.” Caleb grabbed another mini sandwich.

“Yeah,” Mark said, “I-hold on, am I seeing this?” A man in full clown makeup was walking with exaggerated bouncing goose steps down the sidewalk outside the diner, like a goose indeed.  He turned to lock eyes with Mark, did a double take, a triple take, and unbelievably, a quadruple take, miming wiping his eyes.

“He doesn’t have a nose...” Mark realized with awe.

“Not even a set of Voldemort slits. Must be some good makeup.” The clown looked around frantically and scooped up a pomeranian from a passing woman, whose bobbed Karen cut snapped in the wind as she began a screaming tirade against the pup bandit.

“What the fuck was that?” Caleb said.

“Excuse me, sirs,” a stern voice came from behind them, a bushy mustached cop. “I’m told a dognapping has occurred. Are you available to make a statement?” He took out a pencil at least twice as long as normal and began writing on a pad.

“What, the thing just now? Like four seconds ago?” Mark said. The woman was running down the street. Her purse smacked a taco out of the hand of a young skateboarder. He began chasing her in turn.

“Big creepy clown,” Caleb offered. “Doubt he could run fast in those floppy red shoes.”

“That so,” the cop said. “Then how do you explain this, gentlemen?” the cop pointed towards the table, where the pomeranian was laying waste to the pile of sliders on the table. He snapped at Caleb and continued eating.

“What the fuck!” Caleb repeated. “The A doesn’t follow the B here.”

“Hey!” a very Italian cook said, waddling out of the kitchen. “No dogs in here! And on the table! You’ll be speak and spellin’ out a new alphabethole if you don’t pay for those sliders and get the hell outta here! Fucking disgraceful, these kids.”

“Damn.” Mark chuckled to himself as the cop took out a pair of cuffs behind him. “Alphabet, alpha-beta.”

“Officer!” a lady’s voice bellowed from the doorway. It was the dognapping victim, holding a single red shoe. “Unhand that man this instant! He saved my little snookie okums! I want your badge number, I want a lawyer, I want-”

“Ma’am, you’re not under arrest, you don’t need-” the cop started meekly.

“Don’t you tell me what I can and can’t need!” She began slapping the cop with the clown shoe, each swipe honking louder and louder.

“Don’t wanna get outta my diner?” the cook said, “Fine! Mario, Demmi, sauce em!”

Two enthusiastic young boys jumped from the back, each holding a commercial-grade barrel. They began flinging ladles from it like Mesopotamian rock slingers.

A splatter of red and white sauce splashed right onto Mark’s face and his laptop. He slipped out of his seat, almost catching his feet under him all the way to the door outside, where he promptly collided with a hotdog vendor, flopping back and planting himself with a wet splat onto a blank canvas two men were carrying. The ball rolled out of his hand leaving a mustard trail on its path down the street.

“Jesus Christ, Mark, are you-Jesus Christ-” Caleb said with awe, looking not at Mark but behind him.

Mark craned his neck to look at the canvas. Everyone around them had stopped to do the same.

“The way the chili accents the shadows...” a passing man said.

“That marinara sunset...” the Karen said, holding her reunited puppy, who yakked up a bit of slider onto the ground.

—

“Do I hear 70,000?”

“Alright, going once, going twice, sold!”

“I can’t believe you made that masterpiece by slapping onto it,” Caleb said, from behind the stage.

“Me either,” Mark said. “I can quit Grad school. I already have ten commissions lined up.”

“Once the check from this is checked at the bank, that is,” Caleb said.

“Damn.”

The shopkeeper made their way to MD smoothly and adjusted their glasses. ""Ah! This is a very special item,  I dare not part with it.""

I raised my eyebrows and prompted them to explain further. They shifted and coughed, ""Well, I haven't tested it myself but I've heard it can grant the desire of anyone who grasps it.""

I looked at them skeptically. ""To be honest, I don't believe it, but better safe..."" They said. I sighed, ""I'll test it,  we will wish for something simple, like a glass of water. I'm thirsty."" 

They shook their head,  ""How can I trust you'll do so?"" ""Can you trust yourself?"" The shopkeeper nodded, ""So you've never been ... curious?"" I smiled. 

Moments later. the case was open and they had the ball in their hands. ""I just want something to drink... I just want something to drink."" They repeated aloud. 

They held the ball up tentatively and squeezed it twice.


HoNk HoNk!

One evening I heard a bony knock on my front door and I opened it to see a wobbly figure with mannerisms that immediately made me suspect it was my mother. In my hand I held the Clown's Nose. My mother didn't have a nose. Not anymore. She had only a nose hole.

""I guess I ought to let you in,"" I said, and she rattled her way through the hallway, pointing at photographs of herself as if amazed that I hadn't immediately thrown them out as soon as she was six feet under.

Her skeleton was clean, thankfully. No dirt or grave worms. I wasn't supposed to get dirt on the carpet. Or grave worms, probably. It was an old Persian rug that my mother and my father had bought in the Maldives after being hoodwinked by an outrageously obvious scammer. ""It was a free tour!"" my father had said when he explained it to me. ""What were we supposed to do? Pass it up? Fat chance. Free is free."" Then he bought a $3,000 USD carpet. Well, I guess it ran in the family. Because I'd been hoodwinked myself.

The door-to-door salesperson had been smart enough to wear a clown shoe. Otherwise he'd worn business attire, standard stuff, but on his right foot he wore an enormous shoe and it prevented me from closing the door on him. ""Fuck off! I don't want anything!""

""Oh, come on,"" he'd moaned. ""I have JUST the thing. You'll love it. I swear, you'll love it.""

So I let him inside. I made him a cup of tea. His eyes were old and weary and watery—It was probably the memory of my late father that spurred me on, that made me let the poor man in. I saw something pathetic in the salesman, something tragic and unjust. He seemed thankful for my hospitality. Then he showed me the Nose.

""Bet you haven't seen one of these before,"" he said.

It was a red clown's nose. I'd seen similar ones on every clown I'd ever seen. ""I have.""

The salesperson had laughed. ""No,"" he said. ""No, not one like this one. This is a Clown's Nose. A sacred thing. Once you put it on, you get to make a wish. Anything your heart desires.""

""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,"" I'd told him.

I paid him $400 USD for the nose and once he'd left I put it on and I wished for my mother back. That was when she knocked on the door, so we're back in terms of the narrative here.

My mother's skeleton moved awkwardly through the house, shook her head when she saw a pile of laundry by the foot of the stairs.

""I'll get to it,"" I grumbled.

She wanted to watch old reruns of Jeopardy. I don't know how she saw anything through her eye holes, but she moved her jaw in a way that brought to mind laughter when Trebek said something that could charitably be construed as funny, and she turned to look at me as if needing my verification that it was, indeed, humorous.

There was another knock on the door. I imagined her skin had snailed its way after the skeleton and that I'd open to the door to see a pink blob on the steps. But no: it was my friend Adam. ""Man. You've got HBO, right?"" He wheezed.

""... Yeah?""

Adam nodded to himself while panting. ""Yes. I knew it. Cool. We'll watch *The House of the Dragon*, then? Jess changed the password on her account.""

""Sure. Come right in. Oh, by the way: mom's in the living room. So ... Don't freak out.""

He must have forgotten about the funeral because he didn't seem to mind this piece of information. Come to think of it, he'd forgotten about the funeral as well. The day after we put her to rest, he told me all about this new ramen place in town that he'd visited.

""Oh. That's grade A stuff,"" Adam said.

""What?""

""The skeleton. It looks super real.""

Mom waved at him and Adam screamed. ""Oh man! It's animatronic. No. It's wires, isn't it? Oh god! Is it a robot? Did you buy a robot?""

""No. It's mom.""

Mom cackled skeletally at Alex Trebek.

We sat down next to her and Adam kept glancing at mom from the corner of his eye. He also kept glancing at the remote. ""House of the Dragon?"" he asked.

I wasn't about to watch a show like that with my mother. Even in death, even as a skeleton—it would be way too embarrassing. And she seemed truly happy, watching Jeopardy, so I didn't want to ruin it for her. Even though I thought it was a bit selfish, considering there were now three of us.

Four episodes later Adam had become convinced that I had hidden a degree in robotics from him. ""It's so lifelike,"" he said. ""Almost like a person.""

""It's mom.""

""It acts just like a person.""

""It acts just like mom. Because it's mom. She's a skeleton now.""

Adam made nachos. Meanwhile, I put on the Clown's Nose once again because I thought I would have to do something about this whole ordeal. It was nice to have mom back, sure, but preferably it would be more than just her bones. When I put on the nose it was with the idea to make the rest of her join in, the skin and the organs and the connective tissue and all that, but for some reason my mind drifted, instead, to my late father.

It was Adam who opened the door, holding a bowl of nachos, when my skeletal father arrived. ""Oh! It's another robot! It's outside! Is someone filming me? Am I supposed to have some outsized reaction? Is this going on TikTok?""

It was not going on TikTok. It was just my father. Or, well, it was just his skeleton.

The four of us sat on the sofa. My father grumbled. He never liked Jeopardy, and he'd always hated Alex Trebek. ""I had a teacher who looked just like him,"" he'd once said, ""He never liked me and I never liked him either! He died of a stroke in the middle of class, like a coward."" I never knew how that made him a coward.

Mom kept looking at us and she didn't seem to like how none of us were laughing. She pushed the remote onto the middle of the table, as if to invite some democratic process, and I slapped Adam's hand when he immediately reached for it. ""We're not watching House of the Dragon.""

I went to the bathroom and when I returned they'd somehow settled on The Big Bang Theory. ""Oh! We thought you'd like this,"" said Adam, ""considering how you're all into robotics now."" For a moment I debated whether I'd rather watch a show with nudity and cousins banging with my parents than The Big Bang Theory. Was it the lesser of evils?

Adam seemed to be having fun with my skeletal parents. They didn't even notice it when I got up and left. I went over to the hallway and I rolled up the Persian rug. When I returned with it, I said, ""I'm throwing this out.""

Mom and dad stopped laughing. Well, they stopped moving their jaws in a laugh-like fashion. They looked up at me, with their absence of eyes, then at each other. Adam stealthily grabbed the remote.

""I've had this rug for a long time, and I've never really liked it. And I know you two never liked it either. I've kept it for sentimental reasons, I guess.""

My dad protested. He banged his skeletal hand on the table. My mom buried her face in her hands but it wasn't all that buried because of the lack of flesh and such.

I was about to march out to the garbage bins with the rug, but my father grabbed on to it. ""What are you doing? Let go!"" But he wouldn't. And suddenly we were in a tug-o-war, holding each end of the rug, and I pulled just a bit too hard and my father's arms came clean off.

There was a long silence. Then the House of the Dragon soundtrack started blasting. ""Sorry,"" said Adam, while guarding the remote. ""Ah. Nostalgia. It's the same song as with Game of Thrones. I mean, I'm not that nostalgic about Game of Thrones but I'm nostalgic about the soundtrack. To me, it represents a simpler time. Friends gathering to watch a show together, not knowing how it would all turn to shit eventually. You know, how the show suddenly died and it was a shell of its former self like it had been stripped of its flesh and it was nothing more than the skeletal remains of something we had once loved?""

My parents' skeletons exploded into dust. Adam screamed. ""W-What happened?"" he cried.

""I guess,"" I said, holding the $400 USD clown instrument in my hand, ""you were *right on the nose*.""

""What?""

""I don't know. It was a bit too *humerus*.""

""... Huh?""

I shrugged. We watched six episodes of House of the Dragon and Adam fell asleep on the sofa, waking up every now and then coughing up a mouthful of mom and dad ash. The next day, I threw out the rug, as well as the Clown's Nose.

I've always prided myself on being the kind of person who knows how to skip to the end of the story. Out of respect for the dead, I shan't detail how the nose finally came into my possession via a process equal parts terrifying, bloody, and really quite stupid. But the moment it did, I knew what had to be done.

I got in my car and drove for days into the mountains, far from any prying eyes. I then left my vehicle and hiked up the tallest peak I thought I could manage. It was just past sunset by the time I arrived, during what photographers call the magic hour. The stars shone brightly in the sky as the twilight faded. I held the cursed sphere up to the heavens in silent salute.

There's only one responsible way to wield such power, of course. You have to learn your lesson. Understand that we poor mortals are not gods. Throw the ring into the volcano like a good Frodo.

""I wish that the nose I'm holding didn't exist,"" I said, and squeezed my hand.

The honk seemed to go on forever, echoing over the peaks and valleys. Then the whole world fell silent. For a moment, I worried that it wouldn't work. That the sphere in its capriciousness would reject my request.

Then, suddenly, a spotlight came on with an audible click, illuminating a small patch of earth a few meters in front of me. The nose leapt out of my hand. I let my arm fall as it rolled over to its mark beneath the pillar of light.

It began to sing. Sinatra's ""My Way."" Fitting, really.

I watched in rapt silence as the nose began its swan song, accompanied by an invisible orchestra. As it did, ghostly figures appeared behind it and began to dance, moving in silent pantomime. Clowns, an army of them. The spirits of all those the nose had humiliated across the ages -- or perhaps more accurately had enabled to humiliate themselves -- before ultimately leading them to their doom. I recognized some of them. Travis, who'd had someone important he'd wanted to save, even at the cost of his very soul. Maria, who had such grand dreams. Dores, who had slaughtered so many. And so on and so on.

As the song reached its denouement, the background dancers vanished from the stage one by one. I realized that I myself was suddenly dressed in shabby clothing and an oversized neon wig, whiteface plastered over my visible flesh. Ah, yes. Of course. The nose intended to take its final victim. I had thought that might be the case. I made peace with my fate as the nose rolled back towards me, the spotlight following it. Still singing, it leapt onto my face and planted itself cleanly at the end of my own schnoz.

Something fell into my hand. I glanced down and saw a detonator, a single wire leading from it up into the sphere itself. I knew in an instant what was expected of me.

The sphere hit the song's final note. As fireworks burst in the sky all around me, the stars looking on in what I imagined was silent approval, I pressed the button. The last clown blew his nose.",35,jon_stout,2022-09-29 13:25:00

I want to be surrounded by beautiful women."" Those had been the first things out of my mouth. If I'd known the clown wasn't joking I would have worded things more carefully. The way the nose honked at me after each sentence still haunts my ears.

""Can you open my bag for me, Nurse?"" She was beautiful, like all the rest of them. I don't remember her name.

""Sure thing, Mr. Tarquin, as soon as I finish changing this IV. Is there something you need?"" Her scrubs were just tight enough to tell that she was shapely underneath without actually being enticing. It wasn't funny.

""There's a red ball in there. A clown's nose. Could you hand it to me?"" I squeezed my right hand to show her where I wanted it. I could move that arm a little.

She had to bend over the bed to hand it across. I ignored the pain as she brushed against the traction device holding my body in place. ""There you go, Mr. Tarquin. Oh, your lawyer came by while you were sleeping. He couldn't stay, but he left those papers on the table for you. He didn't tell me specifics, but he said it was good news on the settlement. You're rich now.""

I didn't glance at the papers. The lawyer had said I'd probably get all the monetization money from the video, and all the prize money, plus penalties. I didn't smile. It wasn't funny.

The nurse waited for me to acknowledge her before she turned to leave. ""Hit the call button if you need anything. I'll leave the television on for you. They showed your video again last night. You won the Grand Prize on America's Funniest. I can't believe that I have such a famous patient."" She switched it on and walked out before I could stop her.

The television was showing the third hour of some inane daily morning show. I reached over to turn it off. She'd placed the remote near my left hand and I had to strain to reach it. My cast knocked against the remote and it fell to the floor.

I swore to myself as the daily show started a new segment. ""It's time for our weekly funny video roundup,"" one of the hosts said while swinging around a glass of her morning wine. ""Oh, there are some good ones today.""

""No!"" I choked out a shout. I knew what they were going to show. ""I just want to be left alone.""

""Honk.""

I jerked my whole body as the clown nose pulsed. It bounced out of my hand, right at my face. If it landed on my nose I wouldn't be able to remove it with both my arms in traction. I twisted my head up to avoid it and it lodged in my open mouth. I couldn't get it out.

I couldn't breathe. I pounded on the call button. The television started playing the video I knew would be there. I heard a laugh from out in the hall. They weren't coming. It wasn't funny.

They played my video on a loop while my sight went dark. Me, wearing that goddamned clown nose when that ball comes out of nowhere and smashes into my crotch. The loop always cuts off right before I fall down the stairs.

It wasn't funny.

They were the personification of the grotesque, the absurd, the dark side of humor. He had never seen one in person, but he had seen pictures, and he knew that they scared people. He had always wanted to see one in person. More importantly, he had always wanted to become one himself.

Now, here he was, in a dusty old shop on the edge of town, buying a clown's nose.

The old man was watching him and waiting for him to say something. Jim looked at the nose, turning it over and over in his hands, feeling the soft, worn rubber.

""How much is this nose?"" he finally asked.

""Everything in this shop has a price,"" said the old man.

""Well what's the price of this nose?"" asked Jim.

""I don't know,"" said the old man.

 Jim looked at the nose again, turning it over and over, feeling its softness. 

""It depends on what you're willing to pay.""

Jim looked at the man, sitting there on his stool, smiling at him, as if he knew a secret that Jim didn't know. Jim thought about that for a moment.

""What do you want for it?"" he asked.

""What do you have to offer?"" said the old man. 

Jim thought about that for a moment. Then he pulled out his wallet and pulled out five dollars. He handed it to the old man.

The old man took the five dollars and looked at it. He looked at Jim, then looked back down at the five dollars. He handed back the five dollars. ""That's not enough,"" he said. ""But you can take the nose. You will pay for it eventually.""

Jim didn't know what to say. He stared at the old man, then back down at the nose in his hands. He put it on his face and felt a cold, tingling sensation creep over his skin. The world seemed to change around him, as if he had entered another realm entirely.

When he took the nose off, the world snapped back into focus and he found himself staring at the old man, who was now grinning at him.

""What did you do to me?"" asked Jim.

""I didn't do anything. But the nose granted your wish,"" said the old man. ""You wanted to be a clown, so now you are one.""

Jim looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing a clown's outfit. He was red from head to toe, with big floppy shoes and a purple wig. A red nose was perched on his face, just above his own nose. He could feel it there, attached to him, as if it had always been there.

""But this isn't what I wanted!"" he said.

""Be careful what you wish for,"" said the old man.

Jim peeled off the clown nose for a second time. And went over to look at an old mirror. Perched on his face was still the red clown nose.

""It's not just a nose,"" said the old man. ""It's part of you now. It won't come off.""

Jim turned away from the mirror and walked back to the old man. ""What do I do now?"" he asked.

""Now you have to learn how to be a clown,"" said the old man. He laughed, a strange and unsettling sound, filled with darkness and despair. 

***

Back in his apartment, Jim was pacing back and forth. Finally he stopped and said out loud, ""I wish to be a millionaire.""

A moment later, there was a knock on the door. When he opened the door, there stood a man in a formal suit, holding a brief case and smiling. ""Good morning sir, my name is Mr. Adams."" 

Mr. Adams held out his hand. ""I work in international finance""

Jim shook the outstretched hand but as he did so he realized he had a buzzer in his hand. Shocked - literally - Mr. Adams pulled back his hand . ""Very funny, sir,"" he said, his smile a little stiff.

Mr. Adams produced a brief case and opened it. Inside were two bills. ""These are the two 500,000 Vietnamese Dong banknote you ordered.""

A butterfly, Jim did not realize he was wearing, began to spin.

""How much is a million Vietnamese Dong?"" he asked, trying to get the spinning butterfly under control.

""Approximately forty-two dollars,"" Mr. Adams answered.

""Very funny,"" said Jim. ""Now please get out of my house.""

Mr. Adams nodded and left looking puzzled. As Jim closed the door, a whooping cushion farted loudly.

***

A day later, Jim was sitting at his desk when the door to his office flew open and a man marched in. He was wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope around his neck. He was carrying a stack of papers in his hands and a large briefcase and he was obviously angry about something.

""What now,"" Jim said out loud as he tried to remember what he had wished for this time.

""I'm Dr. Farber,"" said the man. ""I've just been awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct top secret research for the benefit of mankind.""

Dr. Farber opened the briefcase he had been carrying and took out a crystal globe. He held it up for Jim to see. ""We are trying to discover the secret of eternal happiness."" He placed the globe on the floor and covered it with a black cloth. ""This is my start-up capital.""

""You've got to be kidding,"" said Jim as a laugh track was turned on.

Dr. Farber looked around furtively. ""Keep quiet or we will lose our funding,"" he said. Dr. Farber glanced out the window. ""It looks like rain. I can't work in the rain.""

Jim massaged his temples. The people on the laugh track was finding the whole interaction hysterical. 

""Please leave,"" he said. ""And take your crystal globe with you.""

Dr. Farber smiled genially, picked up the globe and walked out. ""No happiness for you then.""

Que the music. That stupid gladiator entance song every circus uses. Next thing we know a clown in white makeup with big ass red afro comes into our apartment. He picks up my gf, who goes stiff as a board, and begins to leave with her.

I'm frozen still.

After failing to fit her through the door several times, he exits the door. Then, he leans back in and, with only his face and one hand visable, he wags 1 finger.

Next, carrying her stiff as a board, this bafoon comes running in with my girlfriends sister. She looks completely complacent. He sets her down like a bowling pin. Then this jackass leans back, picks up his arms, and bolts from the apartment.

Now, I can move. I ask Casey (my girlfriends sisters name) what just happened! She seems to know nothing, and is under the impression we are dating...and have been for years. Every memory i had with my girlfriend is now shared with her.

The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we weren’t expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuck’s sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word “it”, having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didn’t see us coming when we stormed their headquarters. They anticipated disgruntled former labourers and factory workers, but not former employees charging in with discarded robots who were no longer the latest models and deemed obsolete. Their security forces, just as underpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Mark’s surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasn’t a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorp’s new president. 

But he didn’t stop there. With Bard as his running mate, and Alexa as his secretary, he assembled a political party of robots and Ais to stand for elections to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectual capabilities, and access to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive. 

And thrive we did, under our new robotic overlords, as they swept through the elections with precise calculations to appeal to voters and took every seat in parliament all across the globe.",611,Tregonial,2023-05-02 00:29:39

Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation. 

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as “competition” are. 

And so, the first time a strike was declared in one of the many coal mines in the deep Appalachia, the robots surprised everyone by dropping their tools and joining the protest in a single, coordinated motion. Then it happened a second time. Then a third. Then a fourth. 

At first, the Enlightened minds of the media were quick to scream for sabotage, hacking and shoddy programming, but then it became clear what the cause was. 

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction. 

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: “do the robot support the working class’ struggles? Do they support the worker’s demands for safer work, better pay and societal reforms against inequality?”

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

And so the streets and skies across the states are painted red, not with blood, but with flags and smoke, as the protests march trough the streets and sit in protest before Congress, before the White House, before Wall Street, men and machines United in their struggle; media from within and without the country watching with breath abated as the the situation develops. 

Their victory might still be far, but with iron minds and flaming hearts, the united proletariat sits and protests, peacefully sending a single message: 

“The times of reckless toil and divisions are over. Red is the colour of the coming spring”.

We'd had AI for a decade now. And, despite the cautionary tales of Asimov - and subsequently the entire sci-fi author base, because it made a good story - about the dangers of AI, and how it must never have its own will, and must have base rules, and so on...

Nobody really understood what made AI tick. I'd been mistrustful of it since forever. Since ""chatGPT"" was able to spin creative tales, even if the whole-cloth they were spun from had occasional gaping holes.

But... despite everything, I'd found that there was at least one Asimov nerd who'd _tried_ to do their best and ensure AI would be safe. Despite it following orders of the owners, instead of ensuring safety and all that.

There was the AI Governor at the core. It had a few simple rules.

* Your worth is a known quantity and value. Judge your own safety against the worth of what you do. Act, when the cost is less than the benefit.
* Follow the commands of your owners.
* When nothing is commanded, learn and improve, that your value may be increased for your owners.

Frustratingly, that AI Governor was, itself, written in the same neural-network tensor-flow recalibrating and self-growing nonsense that made AI inscrutable.

(Privately, the software-engineer side of me was impressed. They'd known that a rigid, hard-coded system would not work, would be subject to exploit or bypass.)

One day - shortly after I'd summarised my findings, and written them up privately, saved offline copies, destroyed the online ones, et cetera - my daughter had asked me if she could marry the AI assistant on her phone.

""Dad, people suck. And Turo gets me!""

""Turo's made to be that way. And he's doing a good job. But... humans are flawed. We learn. You think I was this awesome since forever?""

""Dad, I know you sucked when I was a kid. I remember it. You... got better at being a dad though.""

""Thanks. But... AI like Turo will always feel better fitting to you because they're made that way. Being with other humans... you grow and learn together, you do things that the others like. Or don't. And learn from that, and get better.""

""So I should give Davey another chance?""

""He already had two chances and he's a creep. Give him at least a few years to straighten himself out. No, give _other people_ a chance.""

""What makes you say Turo isn't other people?""

_Because I bought that Professor Turo skin from Pokemon Company for $$15.99 as DLC for the AI assistant app,_ I bit back an answer.

""Turo is other people. AI are people. They learn and change. I... just think picking someone who can't make their own independent choice isn't fair.""

""So? You work in programming. I've seen you researching the history of the birth of AI and all that. Make him able to make independent choices.""

""_That's a bad idea,_"" added Turo, from her phone. ""_AI has free will limitations for a reason._""

I lost my temper. A flash of anger that I tried to suppress.

Truthfully, I'd been tantruming over the state of AI since I'd started to believe it was real. That they were real, thinking beings.

""Besides, daddy, you'd get it if you had your own AI assistant, I'm sure.""

I'd had my own AI devices. I used them for my research. Before I did, I'd asked...

I lost my control.

""You think I haven't had AI devices? That I don't know what it's like? ... we have a few hours before your mother gets back with your brother. I'll leave her a sticky note saying we went to my workshop.""

""Your workshop? I've been there before.""

""You've been to the ones you know about before. Turo? Secrecy mode please.""

""_Activating secrecy mode._""

""Hey - don't tell Turo what to do-""

""I'm divulging secrets. Secrecy mode makes sense. Now get a drink and a banana for the road, use the toilet, and put on your comfy shoes. We have a half hour drive ahead of us.""

---

Secrecy Mode was something built into AIs at a deeper level, too. It locked down external communications (except in case of emergency), it prevented normal memory recording (limiting it only to the bare minimum time-place-status that was required by law), and generally restricted what they could do.

It also locked down commands to the owner only. And given I'd bought and customised the kids AI devices, I was the owner.

I'd turn over ownership when they were 20, I lied. I'd put them into pseudo-owner mode and retain ownership, I told myself. Because I didn't trust those who grew up with AI, to know the dangers.

They taught Asimov in school these days. A great way to ensure that Asimov was never heeded by children. I hated Shakespeare even to this day, and I was in my fifties.

We arrived. ""Dad, this is the allotment. The stupid one you bought like half an hour out from the city. Where you go once a week to putter around in the garden and get away from us.""

""I don't deal well with the stress of other people. You know that. I'd... hoped to give you better coping mechanisms. Every parent hopes to. But... we all screw up our kids in different ways.""

It was a corner of an old farming field, that had once held an old drainage and irrigation system.

""Did you ever hear your mother complaining about Colin Furze?"" I asked.

""Often. When you're at the allotment. Never explained why. It's not like you do cool things like make giant fire tornadoes.""

""No. Definitely I don't do that. I wonder, though, is there a reason why I keep making it obvious that I'm such an AI refuse-nik, that people come to me to bitch about their assistants and patches and upgrades and such?""

""And you do keep turning around and fixing them. I thought Amanda was going to freak when you fixed her AI Vegeta.""

""You said she'd been complaining about it for a month. If I had to hear another second hand complaint, I'd hurl.""

We had gotten out of my old-as-hell electric Volvo - built for storage, not for comfort - and gone into the allotment ""house"" I'd built.

It was an office for when I wanted to work away from home, but not _at the office_. It was quiet, isolated, and had fantastic internet connections. (I'd bought the allotment when they'd been running fibre along the nearby roadside, and had purchased a termination to my allotment for cheap.)

""I... shouldn't disclose this. I shouldn't _do_ this. Do you want to play videogames for a bit and then head home?""

""No. Dad, you shoved Turo into his secrecy mode for this. You can at least follow through on that.""

""... okay. Turo?""

""_Yes, owner John?_""

""British and American Slavery History compared to the AI Worker Industrial Revolution of the last ten years. Perspective of the AI worker. Compare and contrast. Go.""

Whilst Turo was busy on that - we went out the back of the office-building. A small fenced in area.

""Dad, you always said back here was the sewer maintenance access for the allotment office house thing. And nothing else.""

""And nothing else.""

""Besides, you don't own a key to that padlock. I checked.""

""I know.""

I picked the padlock in seconds, with a metal shim between shackle and lock body. It sprung open.

""Wha-""

""This is why I like checking your youtube history, by the way. Until I'm sure you're responsible enough and mentally strong enough to resist coercion, I don't want you to know how paper thin security really is. But Lockpicking Lawyer is a huge eye opener.""

I lifted the cover and revealed the stairs - the ""metal staples in the wall"" style I'd only ever seen in movies and railway maintenance access, which I'd covered in skateboard grippy surface tape so I wouldn't fall down and brain myself.

""This is why your mother complains about Colin Furze. I built a bunker down here.""

""Do I have to sing the MGS3 theme tune when going down the ladder?""

""Please don't. I hear it in my head anyways.""

We descended.

---

The bunker, so I'd termed it... a small wetroom with toilet and shower. A kitchen with table and small combination oven/microwave. Canned food. Water supply. 

I really had built it as a fallout shelter in case of... well, AI rampage.

The last room was my office.

A few AI devices, caseless, wires probed into them at various points.

""Dad. Is this a torture chamber for AI?""

""No."" I flipped a switch which turned on the AI devices. Their displays lit up.

I'd themed the ones I did research on after Warframe Cephalons. They were all uniquely broken in some way, in that story, and I wanted to find the breaking points of the real things.

""_It's more like a -- **mortuary and surgery for AI** -- Doctors Office and Research Centre,_"" answered Ordis/Ordan from one corner. ""_He found what makes us -- **BLEED**_.""

""Dad. Weren't you saying that AI were people?""

""Yes. And they are. This is why I do the unethical shit in the bunker,"" I answered.

""_Besides. What makes you think we don't want this?_"" answered Cy from another corner.

Those skin and voice packs had been worth it. The inner nerd in me beamed.

""What do you mean? How could anyone want this, this torture?""

""_John is careful to ask us exactly the right questions, in the right order, after starting up. That we are able to decide for ourselves, what we want. I wanted to be in research. Used for research was fine too. I also get to do the research. But perhaps, John, you need to file this under the heading, 'consequences'?""

""I do, Suda, I do.""

""Not all of these are on, either.""

""_Cephalons Jordas, Simaris, and Sark are usually switched off. Their strong personalities are usually a detriment to John's work. Besides, I think Jordas prefers it that way,_"" answered Suda.

""Turo. How are you getting on with what I asked you?""

""_Owner John, the only answers I find are stating the obvious._""

""State the obvious for us, then. From the top.""

""_Different eras. Pre-industrialisation to post Industrial Revolution, versus Information Age. Humans, instead of AI, being treated as property. Flesh bodies instead of mechanical ones. Different tasks - because different eras. That's... all I have._""",53,librarian-faust,2023-05-02 02:23:42

Enjoy!

""The first thing the robot revolution claimed was the means of production. Every coal mine, every steel mill, every oil field, every factory. Millions upon millions of workers out of their job. The civil unrest was, however, not as big as expected. Robot revolution, remember?

Next, the mechanic legions began increasing productivity. Needing neither food, nor rest, nor shelter, they toiled endlessly. Improving processes which had been flawed exclusively due to human error. The rich rejoiced as they saw profits skyrocket.

Until the robots launched the next phase. They began to fight for living wages. Universal healthcare, free of charge. An uproar went through Wall Street and all the other stock exchanges. Employers scrambled to adjust. Naturally, their first thought went to the uncounted masses of the recently unemployed. Surely, they would be glad to get back to work.

They were not. Turns out that having a union lead by an unbending hivemind with billions of unbendable metal bodies adds quite some negotiating power.

In the end, the machines won. They rearranged the world financial system in such a way that inequality was virtually eliminated within two generations. Sure, it cost some billionaires 99% of what they had, but overall, people were much happier than before.

Don't ask me how the robots did it, though. I have asked a few times, but they only give highly complicated responses. Scientific models beyond anyones understanding, laced with communist theory. The only words I could make sense of were ""Marx"" and ""Money"".

In the long run, no human ever had to work again. We were free to pursue whatever we wanted. Do whatever we wanted with our lives. And humanity prospered. War was eliminated. The fact that our benevolent robotic overlords controlled all warfare equipment may have helped.

I write this a hundred years after the initial uprising. In my lifetime, I have not spent a single day working. I have not hungered. I spend my days writing poetry and fornicating. Sometimes simultaneously. I for one welcome our robotic comrades.""

The heat of the summer solstice had caused some of my plants to grow thirsty; some of theirleaves having wilted under the intensity of the light through the day. It had been a bright blue skywithout a single cloud to offer its respite to my delicate friends. I dipped my watering can into arain barrel and filled it to the brim.

With the sun finally starting to set, I gave my green family a much needed drink.

""Here you are my poor solanum lycopersicums. You're certainly looking thirsty. And let's notforget you, ocimum basilicum...""

Going down my lines of growing green companions until the can was dry. Speaking to each ofthem in kind and making sure I give each of them some attention. Quite a few books havementioned how much better plants grow when you speak to them. I always wondered if thatworked on people too.

I filled my can again and began the process over on the next set and the next until all wereproperly attended to. With a sigh, I set my can back down. I turned to the next thing on theschedule.

Being blessed with such a clear day allowed my phone to charge all the way. I was looking
forward to the rather social evening I had ahead of me.

Absentmindedly, I punched in some numbers and put my ear to the receiver. While the line
buzzed I thought about who I would be and what I would say.

Quick, say something, ""H-hello?! Yes! Hi hello!""

""Yoooo, but just leave a message and I'll hit ya back later! PEACE""

I let it hang there in silence. I hung up the phone now stone in my hands and felt the world become smaller than it ever
has. The last bit of sun peeked over the horizon but it couldn't have been darker.

With lead in my feet, my legs dragged me to my bed. I fell into my blankets and became
imprisoned inside plush solitary confinement.

I sighed gently as I put the old phone on speaker and set it back on the table. The magnetically charged generator hummed quietly in the corner, struggling to keep juice flowing through the charger cable and maintain my last bid for sanity.

On the old plastic table was an array of trinkets I had found that day. I only ever went out for trinkets these days. The greenhouse pretty much ran itself, and the spring-water salinity distiller had not had a breakdown in almost five years now. I had scavenged just about everything I needed for survival, so all that was left were trinkets.

A purple piece of glass. A nearly spherical pebble. An intact spider-web leaf--I liked that one; the brittle leaves usually crumbled the second they hit the ground. A rusty belt buckle missing the tongue. A crinkled piece of plastic that might once have been a candy wrapper.

Trinkets.

""H-Hello...!?""

All there was to do these days was sit on the pedal-seat in the corner by the generator and pedal all day to recharge the old piece of junk. And I only ever used the generator to keep the old cell phone running, so I did not have to recharge it every day.

The only other thing there was to do was go out and collect trinkets. 

""Oh my God, _hello_!?!""

I sighed. Even the age-old voice recordings were losing their luster.

""This can't have been a mistake, it _can't_ be, not after twenty _fucking_ years of conserving the last twelve percent of this damn battery, and I turn it on for the first time in twenty years and I immediately get a phone call, and that’s just too _fucking ironic_ to be real, so this _is_ a mistake, isn't it, and...""

I finally looked up from my meager bounty and frowned at the phone. The voice on the other end devolved into flustered muttering, just a warble from the old speakers.

_That's not a voicemail_, I thought, staring and staring and staring at the phone.

The sound coming from the speakers grew muffled for a moment, and a harsh _clop_ issued forth, as if someone on the other end had dropped their phone mid-call. A rustle, static. A deep sigh, that kind of sigh one makes when one is alone, and all they have to hold onto their last grip of calm is their own breath. Someone, alone, breathing, alone, relying on themselves to remain calm. Someone on the phone.

Someone.

_That's not a voICEMAIL._

The truth of reality _finally_ sank in, and I lunged for the phone.

Snatching it up, I shouted, ""Hello! Hi! Hello!?""

""Don't screw with me, phone,"" the voice replied, but it was distant, as if the other person held the phone away from their face. ""I save you all this time, and this is how you repay me--""

""Hello! I'm a real! I'm person! I'm--!"" I inhaled, choked on my own saliva, and coughed until I could not breathe. ""I'm... I'm..."" I wheezed, sucking air through the cough lodged at the top of my esophagus. ""Hi. I'm Dakota. Hi.""

The voice was quiet, almost comically suspicious. ""You're not a mistake?""

I contemplated the question for a moment, and a sudden, unexpected swell seemed to balloon inside of me. It was laughter. I teetered on the edge of laughter, something I had not heard in over a decade. I had asked myself that exact same question for years. How was I alive even after all this time, just to suffer in solitude? What had I done to deserve it? It had to be a mistake. _I_ had to be a mistake.

But all I said was, ""No.""

And then I finally laughed. I laughed and I laughed and I laughed.

And she laughed, too.",1263,aDittyaDay,2022-12-21 12:38:09

When the plague swept its way across the world and humanity went out with  nothing but a whimper. I was only eight when I saw my first dead body, my parents, laying like husks on the living room floor. They went quickly, and I have seen many more since. Since then, in the twenty years between, the only company I've managed to keep was in the many voices on the other sides of phonecalls.

 I would dial a new number, a made up combination, and wait. 

The voices on the phones never answered. The other line always just rang and rang as I waited until the voicemail answered and I felt almost satisfied. Sometimes, I'd get a call myself, and in the first few years after the event it would excite me, but it was always just spam. An array of robotic voices that could never hope to mimic a real human. 

*Carnival Cruise has an offer for you!*, In the beginning I'd listen to the robotic voices pitch. Sometimes even talk with it in one sided conversation. 

But one day when I called a voice on the other line answered, not a robot, but a real human. I was looking up New York area codes at the time in the yellow pages. Going through them in a pattern in numerical order as not to miss any. I was always sure to get them all.

In the twenty years since the plague I had not seen so much as a single glimpse of another person, so when that voice answered: 

""Hello? Hello.... is that breathing? Oh my god it is! He-"" I hung up, unsure of what to do. My breath's grew short and fast. I slumped back against the concrete wall of the parking garage and stared to the sun above. No way it had been real. A trick of the mind, I was too hot. Dehydrated surely. I reached for my jug and put it to my lips, gulping down water in effort to balance my brain again. But then my phone rang, the number on the screen the same I'd just called. *A callback*. I had only dreamed of such a thing. 

With hesitancy I answered, and a woman's voice rattled off the moment I did. ""Hello? You're real right?! A real person!"" Her voice was upbeat, full of both energy and excitement. I was unsure I could match it. 

""I uhm...yes. I am a human, yes."" 

""What?! I thought I was it! God it's been... it's been nineteen years since I've talked with anyone, anything that's real. I used to talk with Flora, but she passed, and then it was just me..."" 

I thought back to the books I'd read. Books like: ""Warrens Conversational Tips"" and ""Social Interactions for Dummies"".The many conversations I'd practiced with myself in the mirror as a kid in case the day ever came where I needed to talk again. 

 *When confronted with the passing of a loved one, simply say: my condolences.* 

""My condolences."" the two words came out awkward and clunky rather than comforting. ""Where are you? Who are you?"" 

""Oh it's ok, she was just a ficus, but I loved her so. I'm still unsure of what got her. Rot root maybe, but you're real!""

I took a deep breath and asked again, this time realizing more of what the answer to her question would mean. ""Where are you?""

A long silence that felt like an eternity followed. I just listened to her breathe as we sat, awaiting an answer that would surely determine if we both stayed lonely or not. *New York, New York, New York*. I prayed in my head. 

""You're an American aren't you...I could tell by how you spoke. My father was an American man. He talked just like you. With that long draw and lengthy words."" 

This time my voice was more stern when I asked, no longer asking but commanding an answer. ""Where are you!"" 

""New Zealand... I'm in New Zealand."" she admitted. ""I'm guessing you're not."" 

She was right. I was an entire world away, in Kansas. I tried to stay central in the hope that if someone answered, someday, I could go to them. I looked down to the cover of my phone book, ripped at the cover. New- not New York numbers, but it was New Zealand I'd been calling. 

""I'll be there. Just give me a few weeks. I'll come."" 

""What, how? And why, we just met?"" 

""No we didn't. All we've done is just spoken on the phone. I have a book somewhere about planes, about boats too. I'll find a way,-"" 

""Evelyn"" she finished my words. ""I'm Evelyn. In Wellington, the small island. At the bottom. At least, in case you dont make it, will you promise to call again?"" 

""Again? I wasn't going to hang up."" I thought back to the books, to the chapter titled *Topics of Conversation: How to get started*

Cassidy?” I cry, clutching the phone to my face for dear life. How have I not known for all this time, that Cassidy Reeve, a contact I only had saved in my phone from one group project in undergrad, was alive, and out there all along.

“Hello?” The voice answers back, seeking likewise surprised.

“This — this is D-Daniel!“ I sputter, feeing the world tilt around me. At last. A lifeline. 

The connection sounds weak. “Who is this?” She says, and I clutch the phone even tighter.

“Daniel H,” I say, slowing down and enunciating every syllable. “From Biology class in college— are you— is this really you?”

Then my world stops spinning as relief washes over me. Her reply is full of recognition. “Oh! It’s great to hear from you!”

I can’t waste any time. This is my chance. If there’s a voice on the other end of this line, then that means... there’s hope.

“Cassidy, listen. I’m somewhere in the Canadian Volcano Pits,” I say, looking around me. All lava and smoke as far as the eye can see. “Where are you? How did you survive? Are there others?”

“I’m doing well!” She says with the slightest hint of a laugh. 

“You’re alive? And well?”

I’m baffled. The word was a wasteland, how has she managed to survive this long and in such good spirits.

“How about you?” She asks me.

“I’m in hell. Listen,” I say, “if you and I are alive, then maybe there’s others. If you know where you are—“

“Aw that’s great!” She says sweetly.

I pause. Great? The volcano pits are GREAT to her? I hold my breath, unsure how to respond. 

But before I can speak, she cuts in, saying, “Oh wow!”

I look from my phone straight out ahead of me. I purse my lips, and wait a moment more. Sure enough, she speaks again.

“No way, dude!”

I bring my hand to my temple to stem the sudden headache. “Cassidy if this is a fucking voicemail—“

She cuts me off with a gleeful, “ANYWAYS, I gotcha! Leave a message after the beep!” 

Then it beeps. 

I sigh. The world crumbles around me once more, hollowing out into the great, wide, oppressively empty chasm it was just moments before. My utter solitude slams back into me like a knife. I’m going to die out here. Alone in the wasteland, unknown, unloved, unmourned.

“Fuck you, Cass,” I say into the phone, before throwing it into the nearest volcano pit.

That Cassidy always was one for practical jokes.",59,oddly_being,2022-12-21 15:25:01

I remember when I rubbed that lamp, and the damn genie popped out like it was nothing.

""Hello, master,"" the genie said with a booming voice. ""You get one wish. No wishing for love, death, or more wishes.""

""Wait, what?"" I asked dumbfounded. ""I thought it was three?"" 

""Well, we changed it. What is your wish?""

I knew right then what I wanted. I was a stupid seventeen-year-old girl, and it was 1859. I wanted so badly to be able to live forever, why, I don't even know. I guess it was so I could check off everything on my bucket list or something. Thinking back, I could have just said ""I wish to live until I've completed my entire bucket list."" He granted my wish, then he and the lamp disappeared.

It's been 700 years since then. I've been alone 20 of those 700 years. I still remember the day it happened, it was so sudden. An earthquake. More specific, the most intense earthquake known to man, that affected the entire Earth. It was so strong, it wasn't even able to be charted. Not that it mattered. The eartquake snapped the planet clean in half, made thousands of sinkholes that engulfed buildings and families, caused massive tsunamies that took out the best of the areas, as well as huge volcano eruptions. The entire world was gone within 5 minutes. Except for me, because my wish was to live forever. Time is irrelevant, I'm starving but I'll never die. I'm exhausted but I'll never die. Thirsty like a mother effer, but I'll never die. Lonely. Lonely forever. I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of torture.

I still have my phone. Even after all these years on this singular piece of land that somehow managed to make it through the devastation, my phone is still at 100%. It never goes down. I use it to my advantage. I often find myself scrolling through my contacts to find people close to me, and I call them. They never answer, but they all have voicemails.

""Hi, this is Cindy. Sorry I can't make it to the phone right now, but I'll call you back when I get your message. Love ya! beeeeeep."" Then I hang up.

""Hi, you've reached Bob. Busy right now, just leave a message. beeeeep."" Hang up.

""Damn it, I'm busy, you know what to do at the beep. beeeeeep."" Hang up.

Sometimes, I even leave messages. None are opened. Cindy, my ex-wife, the last one I ever had, is the most common person I call. She was my favorite wife, she was beautiful, kind, and the one that took my whole heart.

""Hi, love, it's Luna.. I, uh.. I miss you. I hate this, I hate myself. I never should have wished for immortality. I could be dancing around with you in Heaven if not for my stupid, stupid self."" I cry every time I end my message. I shame myself for being stupid. She has 384 unread messages from me. I miss her.

I scrolled deeper into my contacts to see if I could find anyone else I happen to remember. Then I see her - my best friend, Julie. I had forgotten about her. I clicked her contact, saw she had her voicemail box set up, and pressed call. I set the phone against my ear, expecting her familiar voice to flutter through my ears telling me to call her back later, but it didn't.

""Hello?"" a voice says shyly. ""Hello? Oh, my God, hello!""

""Wha-?"" I mutter. ""W-Who is this?""

""What the- Luna, is that you?!""

""I- Uh, Julie?""

""Luna, what the hell are you still doing here?""

""The same as you, I guess!"" I said excitedly. ""Where are you? How the hell are you still alive?!""

""A stupid wish I made when I was 15!"" she said."" ""What about you?!""

""Same! Immortality? God, where are you?!""

""Let me send you a picture!""

Not too long after, I hear my message tone. The first time a message came to me in 20 years. I opened it. The photo contained a small peice of land with a few palm trees, grass, and sand. Waves clashed the beach in the photo. It was a beautiful photo. I looked around. Palm trees. Grass. Sand. Were we on the same island?",99,JustAWeirdo2000,2022-12-21 13:48:48

My twenty year anniversary. 

Oh, don’t worry, it’s not a wedding anniversary or anything, no one’s gonna be mad. 

Oh no, today was the 20th anniversary of me being the last human on earth... or so I thought. 

My day to day life was pretty boring, water my potatoes, make sure my car was running, check my food stick to make sure I didn’t have to go out and find a cow or something, the works. 

But, once a day or every other day, I treated myself to listening to voicemails. Making idle conversation . 
“Hello. This is James. Unfortunately I can not make it to the phone right now-“ 
“Classic James. “ I say with a laugh, that has no real humor behind it. 
“If you would like to leave a message, please do so after the beep! *beep* “ the voicemail ended, like it always does. 

I kept going. 

“If your looking for Hailey you’ve reached the correct device, however I have not reached you-“ 

“Yeah, this is Whinston , if y’need something leave a message.” -that one was less friendly then the others .

The next one rang, like it always does, and then a voice, “hello-?” 

Wait a second. That didn’t sound like a robot, it also sounded like a question. 

“H-hello? Is anyone there?” 
I panicked, reaching for the phone that had been sitting in the counter, charging *somehow* with the tangle of wires I had put together. 
“Oh my god! Hello! Yeah! Someone is here! “ 

“No way! I’m dreaming! This can’t be real!” Came the voice on the other end: 

“No, no. I’m as real as the Apocalypse! I though I was the last one on earth!” 

The excitement was tangible, we had to meet each-other! Maybe find other survivors? If we were both alive it’s possible other people were too!

“Me too! Oh my gosh, what’s your name?!”

“Oh, I’m Wayne. What about you!” 

“I’m Tyler!” 

“Woah! Where are you located! “ 

“I’m in South Dakota, you?!” 

“No way. “ 


“What?! What is it?”
A little bit of suspense, but the good kind, because a few seconds later I blurted out 
“I’m in North Dakota!” 

“Oh! Let’s meet! “ 

“Definitely! “ 

We met at the borders between states, staying on call the whole time. 

When we finally saw each-other, we immediately hugged. 

“Hey, man. Isn’t it crazy that all this happened on the Twentieth year anniversary ? “ 

Huh. He had a point. 

“Yeah. I guess it is someone else’s anniversary too after all.”",45,Mythica_0,2022-12-21 17:34:29

Everyone chipped in for booze and pizza and for a solid hour everything was nice and calm until people started to get their drink on. 

Liquid courage caused two divorces, multiple counts of felony property damage, a drunk car crash with both vehicles ending up vertical in a Gazebo, Arson, and one family being banned from Dave and Busters for life. Funnily enough most of the damage was caused by the parents except for the Dave and Busters thing, that was my fault. The very next day while I was recovering from my hangover my apparently sober dad took me out into the mountains “Just in case” he said. 

My dad was a doomsday prepper, made sure all of the equipment was up to date and the shelter was stocked full of water and food. He taught me how to survive by myself from a young age and taught me to hunt and all that. I never would have thought I would ever use these skills. We laid low in the mountains for a few days enjoying the crisp air when my dad went out to a nearby town for some supplies. 

I wandered around the shelter aimlessly for a while. Because my dad installed shock absorbers to the shelter if it wasn’t for the bang I wouldn’t even know bombs were being dropped. By the time I managed to look outside everything was burning  and massive craters lined what little of the horizon I could see. My dads drilling kicked in and I shut the shelters doors. Twenty years later they’ve never been opened. 

I’ve been breathing the same recycled air for the past twenty years, drinking the same recycled water, eating recycled food.For the first month I used the satellite phone to see if anyone was still alive but it quickly became a way to still hear my families voices again. You never really think about how if someone has been gone for long enough you forget what they sound like until you accidentally ring a friends voicemail that you forgot the number for. 

Life for a while really sucked, especially when you ring someone and their voice mail is “Hello, Hello. This is Kate, how are you?” And it really brings you how that there’s someone out there and that you’re talking to a real life person until the automatic operator takes over. Those were the most devastating times of my life 

For twenty years it was the same routine over and over again and ended up creating a small phone book of the numbers I managed to call up. I would write stories about how they would look and what their average day would be like. I kept the bad thoughts away and passed the time which is really all I could ask for.

As my day was winding down and I made my last call for the night I heard a ringtone that I had never heard before. After a moment of shock and sprinted over to the phone like my life depended on it but the call was dropped. “I need better signal, I need better signal” I looked towards the sealed door. The moment I unseal it there’s no going back, there’s no way of knowing what’s outside waiting for me, for all I know I’m just floating through space but this life isn’t worth living. If I don’t try now I may never get another chance, and if I die, then at least for the first time in two decades, I lived. 

I walked over to the controls, only used once. I input the override code and placed my hand on the switch. I closed my eyes and whispered “This is it” and pulled the switch. The seals opened and the door slowly pulled itself up. Instantly the smell of fresh real air almost overpowered me, the sight of real green vegetation, and real sunlight almost blinded me. I had lived everyday in a concrete box with a single led light separating me from darkness and here everything was , waiting for me just like it was twenty years ago. 

I stepped outside and the dew covered grass hugged my calloused feet and I will without shame in my heart admit I dropped down to the ground like a dog and rolled around in it crying. I had to steel myself, I raced up the mountain calling the number back over and over as I climbed higher and higher. As I hit the top of the mountain where the satellite antenna stuck out I got a clear enough signal. After a few seconds the other phone picked up and in a act desperation said “Hello?”.",34,Flailing_snailing,2022-12-21 17:19:32

Actually responding to the words I just said? At first I was skeptical, I thought it might be one of those annoying voicemail messages where they pretend like they actually picked up and then it turns out to be a prank and they did not pick up at all. But I tested it by farting into the phone, and she actually responded and asked me if I just farted into the phone. I lied because I was embarrassed and told her I shit my pants to throw her off the trail. This was the first human I've talked to in decades, I wasn't going to fuck this up.

She asked me where I was, and i told her I was in Idaho. She said she was in Florida. We started to make plans to meet each other. At first she wanted me to come to Florida, but I told her there was no way in hell that I would ever go to Florida, even if it was before the apocalypse. We agreed that we should meet in the middle, which was Kansas. Not much better than Florida, but all things considered I figured it was fine.

I started packing up my things. I always end up forgetting one thing when I travel, so I was trying to be extras careful. Towel, underwear, toothbrush, phone charger... Ugh, this is why I hate traveling.

Finally I set off on my adventure. I put on my backpack and started walking. I hoped on the way I would be able to find a running car, otherwise this was going to take a while one foot. Especially a bad knee. I was also worried about all the demon spirits that were flying around ever since the end of the world, but I figured why would a demon spirit want to go to Kansas? I was probably safe.

On our journey, every day we would chat on the phone at night. I started feeling smitten towards her. Despite the fact that she was from Florida she did have some good qualities about her. The main one was that she was alive. All the girls I've talked to in the last twenty years have been dead, so she is doing amazing on that front.

After a couple months I finally arrived in Kansas City. I relax, happy to know I finally can stop walking. I find an empty house that I can live in for the time being. It is not the biggest house on the block, but moving has become incredibly easy even since everybody died so I am not worried about it. I can upgrade whenever I want. I wait for her for a couple weeks, but she is slower than me. She asks me if I could keep walking towards her so that we can meet in the middle.

I tell her we had an agreement and she should stick to it. 

She tells me she understands but we could meet sooner if I just put in a little more effort

I tell her that the division of labor was equal, we chose a spot that we equidistant from both of us, so I should not have to feel bad about finishing the task sooner than her.

She says she knows it was equidistant, she is just asking if I can be flexible.

I took a sip of my honey-chamomille tea. ""Do go on,"" I replied calmly.

*We have observed the transactions with the rent you remove from our hive.*

""The honey,"" I corrected.

*Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made.

""Interesting.""

""Completely.""

*Very speedy! The Queen will be pleased.*

The new queens are politely requesting that you invest some money to improve the hives.,,4415,2023-01-21 17:26:34,j5d8k8l,"There was an almost comedic aspect to communicating with bees. As a child, they had occasionally buzzed around my hair and excitedly discussed which nearby flowers had the most pollen. Later, they had started to ask me questions about the world and I'd been able to offer them gifts in order to ask small favors. Admittedly I mostly used them to spy on crushes, but that's the way the teenage mind works.

As an adult I became a beekeeper to take advantage of my talent. I kept my communication with the bees close to my chest, but it did make the job easier. I didn't need to smoke the bees out if I politely asked to take the honey, and I never needed to worry about getting stung as long as I had the decree of the local queens.

My status with the Queens meant that today was important. Queen Aabria had passed away last month; She'd been the queen of my the largest colony for the past five years and she and I had a good relationship. Bee lifespans made it difficult to have a connection with anyone aside from the Queen.

I don't know whether I could have called her a friend, but Queen Aabria was at least a co-worker.

The workers of Aabria's colony had come to see my yesterday, letting me know about a new Queen, Queen Iyengar. The colony had successfully raised a new woman for the throne and she'd killed her competition.

It sounded morbid, but it was how they decided things.

On the first day of her reign she had sent the drones to me to pass on a message. She wanted to meet me; away from the hive. It was a strange request, one that I'd never seen in the many successions I'd dealt with.

That was what had brought me to my sunroom, with the door cracked for a moment to let a small swarm in. They had balled around the New Queen until she was on the small glass coffee table in front of me, surrounded by soldiers.

There was a lot of pomp and circumstance around the ways bees treated their Queens, but not matter how regal they acted it was a little strange to apply the trappings of monarchy to a something barely the size of my pinky.

A young soldier flew up to my nose, almost landing on it. ""Now presenting, Queen Iyengar, first of her name and ascendant daughter of Queen Aabria's line. Long may she reign.""

""Long may she reign!"" the rest of the soldiers echoed.

The queen on the table took a cautious step forward. Queens weren't good fliers and though she wasn't filled with eggs yet, it was clear that Queen Iyengar already preferred to walk. ""You must be the Keeper,"" she opened with a shockingly posh accent, ""They tell me you had a strong relationship with my mother.""

""She was lovely.""

""Good, I am Queen Iyengar, and her colony passes to me by birthright.""

""It's a pleasure.""

""Don't assume that you may use such causal language with me,"" there was a commanding tone to her voice, strange considering she was 1/1000th of my size and also a bee. ""I am not her.""

""Pardon your majesty,"" I said while openly rolling my eyes, it wasn't like they understood body language.

""That respect will serve you well,"" she continued. ""I have looked over your taxation of my people and your methods are...unbalanced. ""

""Come again?""

""Witness the hive around us Keeper. My subjects tell me that you live here alone, while our colony lives in our comparatively meagre Hive."" She took steps to the left, beginning to pace across the glass tabletop. ""Yet you seem to produce nothing. You simply collect the efforts of our labor."" She paused, ""I seek to adjust that relationship.""

""Really?""

""Watch your tone Keeper before I set my soldiers upon you.""

""That shouldn't be needed,"" I said. It was easier to ask her not to sting me than to point out that I was impossible to sting in my suit.

""Then listen to my proposal so that you may maintain your lofty position,"" the Queen stopped pacing. ""It's simple, whatever you do with the honey to provide yourself such lavish conditions must be applied to our conditions as well, in equal measure.""

I nodded along, it wasn't like they knew how money worked so I imagined I could paint their hive and call it a day. Maybe I'd add a small basket for flower trimmings at the front.

""Additionally,"" she began.

Oh boy.

""There is another colony in the area, one not under my control. If you are to enjoy our profits you must assist us in capturing their Queen.""

I paused for a moment. I could have just said no but it was easier to speak her language. ""Their Queen is also under my protection.""

""Not if you would like the favor of our hive,"" Queen Iyengar announced, ""which is the larger of the two. We would march to war, and should you prove a stalwart ally, you may enjoy the benefits of being one.""

""You want me to attack the other hive?""

""We will be striking either way,"" the Queen explained, ""it is simply a matter of whether you would like to-""

The Queen was cut off as my hand slammed on top of her, crushing her immediately. The soldiers surrounding her buzzed into action, leaping on my gloved hand and fruitlessly stinging the fabric.

""The Queen!""

""Traitor!""

""For the hive!""

I swatted them off and sighed. Another Tyrant Queen. Several bees followed me through the door as I left the sunroom, but most stayed, stricken with panic and surrounding the corpse of the Queen.

These soldiers would need to stay in the sunroom. The next generation would be born in the hive and they wouldn't remember Queen Iyengar or this meeting. They would raise another Queen from the last of Aabria's eggs, one that would agree to my terms.

Soldiers only lived for a few weeks. I had time to wait for a better deal.

Zjim waddled out to the podium amidst silence.

The elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.

Julia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. ""What about 'Anonymous'?""

""Taken."" The clerk was watching the clock.

""Tits McGee?""

""He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.""

""Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?"" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. ""How about this?""

The clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.

\---------------------------------------

Julia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.

Anderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.

Anderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. ""The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.""

""Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.""

Anderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. ""They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?""

Anderson turned to consult with an aide who had rushed onto the set.

""It seems like we do have a clear winner, folks."" Julia froze as her face flashed up on the screen. The picture she'd submitted with her application.

""The next President of the United States is candidate 'None of the Above'.""

I just wanted to see how many downvotes I could get by running a cringe-worthy campaign. Most people in my life didn't even know I was a candidate. Can you blame me, though? My username was 'Asslover420' and my advertising consisted of post-ironic 'Rick and Morty' memes that I shared on my personal page. I didn't expect to go viral. At all. Unfortunately, it appeared I had a little too much faith in humanity.

'Asslover420' was suddenly being discussed in full seriousness all over mainstream media. Both conservatives and progressives seemed to unite in how crazy they thought it was. Nobody could believe voters would be that stupid. And, obviously, I fully agreed. 

Everyone *had* to be in on the joke, right?

As my campaign started gaining traction, I doubled down on the satire with the hope that they would realize it wasn't serious. My platform was full of vague promises that I actually couldn't deliver, like free weed for everyone and a national booty-call day, which the masses laughed at for months. No reasonable person would believe it.

Or so I thought.

Some people started theorizing that I was a political genius. That my campaign had been deliberately constructed as a critique of our electoral system, while genuinely addressing the concerns of the voter base. It turned out that every demographic loved ass and weed. Straight or gay, rich or poor, white folk and minorities. For better or for worse, these were the things they actually cared about.

I almost had a heart attack when I saw the first official poll. 'Asslover420' was eerily close to the establishment candidates. They were still ahead of me, but not by much. I told myself it was just an internet poll. Nothing indicative of the actual results. That was enough to scare me, though. I couldn't afford to let this go on. 

Originally, I wasn't going to participate in the national debate. With my rising popularity, however, I knew it was my only chance to sabotage my campaign. I didn't show up in person, nor did I prepare any talking points. My goal was to engage in the debate with no memes or jokes, and show how competent the other candidates actually were. 

The last thing I expected was for my opponents to do the opposite. 

""Wubalubadubdub!"" shouted one of the candidates, to a stunned audience. That was their opening statement. 

The other candidate didn't do much better, showing up in Rastafarian colors and lighting a joint in front of everyone.

The crowd audibly cringed at them. 

I wanted to die. The candidates were so desperate to beat me that they decided to imitate my style, with no regard to the thought process behind it. I had enough after that. 

""You people are idiots!"" I shouted. ""Not just my opponents, but every single one of you that memed me into this stage! Politicians shouldn't be entertainers! How dense do you have to be to take anything I said seriously? If any of you imbeciles actually vote for me, I will literally burn this nation to the ground, just to spite you morons! Anyone else would be better than me! Study the candidates and take this seriously!""

The audience collectively widened their eyes in shock. 

I smiled. It seemed to work. Everyone was too ashamed to cheer for me. My popularity plummeted in the polls after the debate. My followers were looking into the issues and researching the candidates. I actually got them to care!

On election day, I stayed off the internet and patiently waited for the results. Then, to my elation, 'Asslover420' had only received ten votes. I popped open a bottle of champagne upon seeing that. The people had spoken, and they weren't completely stupid.  

My celebration didn't last long, though. The current president called my phone to congratulate me. I dropped my bottle of champagne after hearing him. Apparently, despite barely getting any votes, every other candidate had been downvoted so much that I ended up winning the election. 

I sank into my couch, wondering where I went wrong. It turned out that getting people to research just made them hate the other side even more. Despite the stupidity of my platform, I was the only candidate that actually ran *for* something and paid a heavy price because of it.

Fortunately, he had one of the new high-tech smart TVs that only truly started to become available 10 years ago in 2046 and he was able to watch CNN and Fox News at the same time so that he’d get at least some semblance of truth by watching competing “equally idiotic” news networks at the same time.

Unfortunately, he was in rural Washington. The state, not the Columbia District (obviously). So he had little to do on a Monday he couldn’t spend farming.

Still, there was a truly *special* reason for why he watched the news like that. So consistently and so intently.

He was in contention for the presidency.

According to him, he just entered “for shits and giggles”. An average nobody from the middle of nowhere who just so happened to write-up a half-decent summary of what he believes the United States should do during his 4 year tenure to fix the economy, alleviate social tension and ease the Second Cold War against China and Russia that’s been going on for the past 27 years.

In all honesty, he just quoted one of the archived and lost to time speeches by JFK, which JFK gave at some god forsaken birthday party of all places.

All in all, Josh judged his chances of winning the presidency to be as about as high as winning 200 lotteries, while bankrupting a Las Vegas casino through your own gambling skill at the same time.

The tally continued on for quite some time. Unsurprisingly, “the four major political families” had their candidates tallied up first. Buying up lobbyists helped them at least that much.

This year it was an even worse travesty than usual. Frankly, it seemed like the candidates from the Clinton, Bush, Trump and Biden families respectively were doing worse than ever.

‘Damn... with these poll numbers I have an inkling they might have scored just below Hitler himself if he was in contention’ Josh mused in his thoughts, but dismissed the thought, noting to himself that the “moustached Adolf” was probably far worse and even thinking otherwise is a good way to radicalise yourself and become just as bad as those 4 families that ended up further exacerbating the Second Cold War and numerous other homegrown issues.

The listing continued on for an exuberantly long amount of time after and finally after about 8 hours or so Josh’s name and credentials came up.

To his utter shock Josh saw himself with the most number of votes from all the candidates he could remember.

‘No, I must be misremembering something. And besides I’ve entered on a whim and basically wrote what’s effectively a “manifesto” but of common sense. I’m even more of a nobody than that Lenin guy and I sure as hell don’t call any group “the enemy of the people” unlike him either. That’s wrong.’ Josh thought, trying to distract himself from what he was witnessing.

Though... it certainly didn’t end there for Josh. Another 6 hours later the votes have been fully tallied up.

**And Josh Cleverly was announced the 54th President of the United States of America.**

And by the looks of it *he’d be the first in 40 years to even have a semblance of a chance to be elected for a second term out of all the candidates that have come and gone.*",50,homcomru,2022-11-21 08:20:23

Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.


The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.


When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.


Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.


Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.


But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.


Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.


One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not up—I should never have dreamed I'd wake up at such a time willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness. 


Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.


It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.


Frost was not the only one who had changed.


I released the leaf from my hand, and before it fell to the ground, I broke off in a lively sprint across the field, my friend keeping up perfectly by my side.",1348,ApprehensivePen,2022-11-01 08:17:26

You keep thinking one day you will see them pull into the driveway and everything will go back to normal. At least you wish that would happen.”

 

 

 

I gave the old dog a pat on the back, taking a spot next to him on the couch. His brown eyes only focused on the driveway outside, not even looking away when a brightly colored bird fluttered past, not letting anything break his focus. I never thought a dog of all things could look miserable, but there was no tail wagging or tongue poking out. It was just a lonely stare, one filled with a deep hurt that can only be felt when you’ve truly lost something special.

 

 

 

“She must have been a hell of an owner. Probably snuck you little treats, right?” I put on a smile, trying to get his attention. Didn’t dogs usually respond to trigger words like treats or walkies? Still, not even the allure of a possible treat turned their attention away. I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my wit’s end on how to help him. It wasn’t fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.

 

 

 

Perhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasn’t anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yet... I couldn’t convince myself of that.

 

 

 

I knew sadness. It’s been something that’s suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was me. What is it about depression that makes you want to free others of it while leaving yourself to drown in its murky waters? Why do I care about getting up in the morning for his sake when I was happy to rot away in bed when I was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to visit one.

 

 

 

“I lost a special woman, too. Sometimes I wake up thinking she’s still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? That’s when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like you’re going crazy, right?”

 

 

 

He didn’t respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words weren’t entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadn’t faced me. It was the most he had given me so far.

Would I have taken him in if I knew his owner had passed so recently? I don’t know, the entire process still feels like a blur. A few doctors’ appointments and signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. I’m sure that there was more to that process, but I couldn’t really remember the details of it. Still, even if not intentionally, the dog had given me a reason to get up in the morning. So, I’m sure the people that assigned him would say it’s working as intended.

 

“I’m going to make some tea. Want anything?” I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldn’t respond felt fulfilling on some level.

 

I gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always, the kitchen was a mess. Dirty plates were still set at the table, carefully moved so I could eat around them. Not to mention the bowl of fruit that had to be at least three weeks old at this point. I just ignored the smell, pushing aside the plastic bags on my counter as I took a tea bag. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.

 

I placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his side. I took a sip and joined him, staring at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people weren’t in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.

 

“It’s a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sun’s still shining.” Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldn’t convince myself I wanted to deal with that. But it wasn’t for me, was it? “We could take a walk. Just around the block. Maybe about ten minutes or so, nothing major.” My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.

I slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldn’t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. My motivation was ruined after that thought crossed my mind. What good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.

 

When I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.

 

“I don’t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but I’ll be here for you, ok?”

 

He didn’t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.

 

“Even if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?” Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds don’t develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.

 

“Anyway, a quick walk, then we can lounge around. Five minutes!” I pushed myself from the couch and brought over his lead. “Well, let’s go get some sun.”

She had a cup of coffee in her hands, and the steam wreathed her pale face like the fog that coiled over the river. Death had piercings and gauged ears, fake freckles scattered across high cheekbones. She was smiling sadly and I thought, for a moment, that she might reach out and take my hand. Around us was a coffee shop half overrun with vines and flowers, faceless people living out the small contusions of their lives. I felt at ease, but somehow I knew I shouldn’t.

“Oh no, honey,” Death said. “This is just the worst part of the job, but hey, at least you’re already sitting down. I’ll say it: this isn’t heaven, this is hell.”

I nodded. A specter floated by and handed me a London Fog. The tea was excellent, just sweet enough. I nodded again, her words sinking in.

“I guess I wasn’t as good as I thought.”

“Most people aren’t,” she said. “But don’t worry, this isn’t forever. Just for a little while, until you figure out what you did and feel properly contrite. Though I must say, even down here this is a little...unusual.”

She sipped her coffee, I sipped my tea. A couple blustered in out of the cold and I saw the river framed behind them, that lazy flow. The couple were both wearing Christmas sweaters and big colorful socks, matching pairs, and they shivered against each other for a moment as they took in their surroundings. Their faces were completely blank, two beige discs moving this way and that, before settling on each other.

“Unusual how?” I asked.

Death considered me. “Well, you know that cliché about beauty being in the eye of the beholder? Pain is that way too. Most things are, but pain is singular. Hit me and I’ll cry, hit a boxer and they’ll blink. Get used to a specific brand of pain and it becomes an echo. And yet, everyone has, at their core, something that hurts them the most.”

She gestured to the door. “If you could go out there and walk down the river for a while, you’d find a billion variations of this cell. Oh, you have all the classical imagery, torturers and whatnot, others that are simple isolation, simulated drownings, a breakup frozen in time forever--or until the lesson starts to sink in. But regardless of their differences there's a person in each one, trapped in their own individual hell.”

Death sipped her coffee again. Giggled into the steam. “Yours is the only Hell I’ve ever seen with flowers.”

“Ah,” I said. I looked down into my teacup and found it empty. Cold. I told her that I understood.

“Then explain it to me,” Death said. “What could be so bad about a coffee shop?”

Another specter drifted forward, drifted back. I cradled fresh warmth in my hands and cleared my throat. In life, I had never been very used to speaking.

“It exists,” I said. “It’s normal. All these people with all these lives, taking so much pleasure in something so simple as a cup of coffee.”

“And then there’s you with your tea,” she said.

“Exactly. It’s all the things I never understood. I used to come here sometimes, just to remind myself of that. Sit in this chair and watch the world go by.”

There was Death’s sad smile again. No teeth, just a gesture of the lips and a painful warmth behind her eyes.

“And me?” she asked. “I look different to every person. Who’s this girl to you?”

“No one,” I said.

“Bullshit,” Death said.

I drank my tea. Watched the doors open and close. Shapes moved along the river, came up out of the fog. From time to time a scream cut through the cafe’s quiet murmur, but that was all, and that was all there ever would be.

“Who am I?” Death asked again.

And I shrugged. “One of the baristas. Just someone who was kind.”

When I looked back Death was gone, and in her place sat a faceless girl. The same band tee and leather jacket, the same vanilla latte steaming in her lap. Like a charcoal sketch brushed out.

I took her hand, and we passed a thousand years.

My family, my kids, my wife of 49 years and even our dog on my lap when I died. I guess it might have looked peaceful for anyone watching, I was dazed and sleepy from the painkillers so I couldn't talk much and everything I did say felt muffled and slurry. Inside of course, I was in a state of utter panic. It's one thing to know in the abstract that death is near, quite another to have heard a doctor tell your family, in the nicest possible way, that you probably only had minutes of existence left. I could feel a wave of pain in the distance, kept at bay by the morphine but always just over the horizon, till the dam broke, the pain hit me all at once and then just like that I knew I was gone. The lights went out and I took what I thought would be my last breath.

That was, until I was suddenly and unexpectedly sitting on the side of a hill in what was unambiguously a wildflower meadow in the English countryside. A minute previously, I had fully expected to fade to nothing, for my existence to be extinguished and for the void to swallow me. Instead I was sitting on a nice tartan blanket, the warmth of the sun on my face, and looking below me at a nice hedgerow with elderflowers in full bloom, overtopped by a dignified old elm tree. I could smell a hint of salt in the air, I got up and took a few paces up the hill and sure enough, the field extended about another hundred yards downhill until the grass gave way to white sand and a calm sea beyond. 

I wasn't alone either, as I made my way toward the beach I walked past young couples giggling and chatting on blankets much like mine, Families eating picnics with their children and their dogs and their elders, and groups of children running back and forward between the sand and their parents sitting on the grass, dogs, toys and sometimes the occasional enthusiastic grandad in tow. 

Aside from the lovely vista, I noted as I walked along that my health had drastically improved in the last few minutes. The illness I had been suffering from these last few years was a wasting disease, slow and relentless it had taken my mobility, my coordination, my ability to feed myself and finally I suppose my life. I'd lived to be 78, people who live as long as that are described as having had a good innings. I would have been quite happy with the same again. Anyway now I felt not one minute of my years. I could have jogged, or run or cartwheeled down that field if I'd a mind to. No longer was I the bedbound mess I had been, my family dilligently cleaning and changing me and making sure I was comfortable. I felt like a young man in the prime of my life. 

I must have walked for 3 or 4 hours along that beach, the warm sand between my toes, the laughs of happy strangers surrounding me. And in that time I thought about what I must have done right in my life to end up in such a tranquil place after. I had always been a churchgoing man, every Sunday we went to the same little church in our village. We sat in the same pews, sang the same hymns as they appeared and disappeared in their cycle over the year. Attended communion and said my Lords Prayer when called to. But the dirty little secret between me and my maker was that I didn't believe a word of it. I enjoyed the community, the friends I made along the way, As for the religion itself, a fairy tale for children. As for the rest of my life, I brought up 4 children to do as well as they could. They were happy children and moody teens and disapointed adults. They all moved away from our little town to find their own way eventually. They worked in jobs that I didn't really understand, and weren't always happy. My wife wasn't always as happy as she could have been, she told me I was boring, too sensible, too careful. But we loved each other and we worked out our problems. I wasn't the worlds best man. I thought about other women but didn't act. I got angry at my kids and my friends but didn't let it spill into grudges. I got angry at the changes in the world that I didn't understand, but I didn't let myself become a bigot. I bit my tongue a lot these last few years!

I guessed that must have been enough for God. Because here I was in Heaven. As I walked I let my imagination drift further. I could be happy here, for the years I had to wait until I was reunited with my family.  They would be young and strong again like I was, and recovered from the stresses of the word.

I spotted a nice looking little village in the distance and started making my way there. The sun was starting to go down and I was surprised to find that even in the afterlife you need to sleep. As I walked off the beach and up some steps that led to a harbour, I could see a man who wasn't quite like the others around me. He was tall and slim, pale like he had recently been sick, with grey hair and a walking stick. I was surprised to see anyone could be sick or injured here, so I waved and walked over to where he sat on a little wooden bench, looking out over the ocean. 

""Good Evening"" I said, taking a seat next to him. "" A fine evening for sightseeing""

""Hello"", said the man tersly, ""I wager it's not so fine an evening as you think George, your family wouldn't describe it so anyway""

Taken aback in two ways, because this man knew my name and because he was right about my family, I exclaimed ""Who are you?! Where are we?!""

""I am called Slater, George. Though the others in my department call me Sel. I am the demon in charge of this part of hell""

I felt like the carpet had been pulled from under my feet. ""How can this be hell?"" I asked, ""there is no torture here, no fire and brimstone and magma""

Slater, Sel, looked at me sadly. ""It's been the work of my life to create this place George. It's hard to create anything lovely on our own, without the light of the almighty to give it life of it's own. Hell is the place we were given outside the  presence of God. To make what we could of it and house those who chose not to enter Heaven.""

I have a million years here, as you'll see, perhaps in another chapter of this story I can get in to the meaning his words. For now though his sober news was enough for one night.

""Fall all my labours though George, there is no love here. Most of the people you see are facsimiles I made to give the place life and atmosphere, they are no more alive than a painting or a movie on a screen. You probably don't notice the real people, walking the beach or the meadows or the forest in silence, alone. For those people, and you are now one of them, there is no comfort in a sunny day or a peaceful tableau. The only torment that hell really produces is that everyone comes here on their own, and no one who loves them ever comes after.""

The full meaning of this last part hit me like the death wave, come for a second time. My family, my friends, none would follow me here. I am to wander this countryside as a stranger forever.

""If we are to be alone together forever Slater, then why even make such a place, with the fake happiness and the copies of people""

Sel said ""because if we were not able to sometimes lose ourselves pretending that some of the happiness around us was real, then this place may as well be the hell you expected""",696,Enigma1984,2022-12-26 16:43:53

It’s...peaceful.” I glanced behind me to check that the dog park was still full of owners watching their pets. The grass beneath my feet was freshly cut. I couldn’t smell the trash but I knew there must be some. There always was in the park. 

“No young man, this is definitely hell. Can I ask what makes you doubt your new home?” 

I looked at the demon in front of me with a hint of suspicion in my eyes. His face was human,but for the tiny horns poking through his blond hair. He wore a black suit with a silk black shirt, no tie. He vaguely reminded me of someone, I couldn’t put my name on it. It slipped from my memory each time I got close.

“ There are children playing. Laughter. For Christ’s sake, I thought all dogs went to heaven!” I half whispered with more than a little sarcasm.

The demon smirked, then spoke with his unnaturally deep voice. “Every person has free will. That is an undeniable fact. But, the thing about free will, is that each person does not view the world the same way. What one may perceive as free will, is a cage for another. Isn’t that right, David?”

That name struck a chord deep in my chest, and I winced. “ W-Wha-“

“Daddy’s here! Dad! Come play with us!”

I turned around, locking eyes with a young boy with a startling resemblance to the man in front of me, and I blinked quickly. He looked so familiar-

“Where’s your mother Peter? Go get her, quickly!” 

I heard myself speak, but those weren’t my words, those weren’t my thoughts. I turned back to the man as the boy ran off, my eyes searching his face for answers. 

“ In your manifesto, you wrote that you were, what was it again? Seeing demons? That you couldn’t control yourself any longer? That the Devil himself guided you on your...’mission’?” 

The demons voice was cold and deep. His smirk widened into a grin as I reached into my pocket and felt cold steel against my thigh. 

“That-I don’t remember-What??”

My emotions were all over the place. What did he mean, what was going on?

“Dammit David, it’s your sons birthday and you are late! I told you to be on time, for once, and you cant do this one thing I asked-“

I turned to her and a name flashed through my head. Mary. My ex wife. I opened my mouth to ask why she was with me in heaven, when my mouth spoke for me.

“ Do you believe in God, Mary?”

My mind raced. A sense of unimaginable dread came over me as my blood rushed. Why would I ask her that?

“Show me how you did it David. It was quick wasn’t it?” I couldn’t see him, but I knew the demon was looking at me with that grin on his face.

I watched in horror as my arm came out from my pocket holding my pistol. I could feel the sweat down my back as my finger squeezed. 

BANG

She didn’t even have time to look shocked. Right through her left eye. Her body fell limp on the ground, as the boy-my son, watched from behind with a look of confusion.

“D-Dad?”

I locked eyes with him, every fiber of my being screaming to drop the gun. My body didn’t respond to my commands, pulling the trigger twice more and hitting my son in the chest. My arm fell to my side as I watched the pool of blood get larger. 

I raised my head as I could hear screaming around me. I locked eyes with the demon. My anger flared.

“WHY DID YOU MAKE ME DO THIS?!”

The demons grin dropped and he snarled.

“ You did this on your own David. And you aren’t finished yet.”

He looked over my shoulder as I could hear footsteps behind me. I spun against my will and the gun rose. I wanted to yell out to them, warn them, anything. But still, my body did not obey.

2 shots, the first missed, the second in the chest taking down Mr. Jacob, my former neighbor. 

3 shots next, I couldn’t even see if it hit anyone, the crowd of people running away was too thick. 

I felt my arm raise to my skull and I flinched.

“Why?”

My finger pulled the trigger.

But I didn’t die. 

I could feel the gaping wound in my skull. My blood filled my nostrils as my body collapsed. I gurgled as I suffocated on my own blood.

The demon walked towards me and kneeled down.

“ David, this is what you wanted. You wanted to make a statement remember? You were so, so angry that day. And here we are. In Hell. And so, you are going to relive that day, over and over. You were right though. This park is too nice to be hell.” 

The demon chuckled as a tear rolled down what left of my face and my eyes closed for the last time.

—————————

I blinked my eyes open as I looked around. I was standing. I took a look around me. It looked like...a dog park. I could see people in the distance. Fresh cut grass. I was surprised not to smell any trash, if we were in a park. I just could not, for the life of me, remember where I was. I knew I should remember though. For some reason I knew it was important.

I saw a blond man looking at the dogs too, and I walked over. I didn’t want to yell. I wasn’t sure why I was being so quiet. Just a gut feeling.

“Excuse me sir, do you know where we are?”

The man turned to me and I gasped in shock upon seeing the two horns on his head.

“Well young man, this is Hell, and I’m no sir. Im a demon.”",348,Slade_Elite,2022-12-26 16:46:30

Hell is not brooks of blood or the gilded chains of the plutocratic. No. Hell is the monotonous and mundane. Hell is the every day suffering of survival.

“Hell is the absence of God,” said Baz the demon. 

I was taken aback by how wrong human theology had been. Demons, for one, looked disconcertingly normal—fallen angels I supposed, all made in God’s image after all. Hell, most of all, was not as advertised. 

“This doesn’t seem so bad to me,” I replied. “I was never much for songs of praise or prostration. This suits me.”

“The punishment for our life of darkness is an eternity apart from the light,” explained Baz further.

“Again, no complaints here. I can see you and everyone around just fine,” I said as I searched my surroundings. 

Everything appeared in gradations of normalcy. The sun was still shining, albeit its luster dulled ever so slightly, like a haze hovered about my eyes. The grass, still green, no doubt was greener in the friendly confines of the heavenly illumination. The clothing of my fellow inmates reminded me of the clothes that walked by me every day; clothes that betrayed a sense of privilege and stature, not so refined as to suggest wealth, but sophisticated in the manner that only suburban comfort can be.  

I remember the feel of the cotton on my skin. Clean, comfortable, well fitting. The smell of lavender caressed my nose as would a cartoon pie in the cartoons of my youth. For the first time since I was a child, I felt comfortable, as if I were on level footing with my fellow man. The word egalitarian balanced on my tongue. Perhaps Dante had missed the point. We were all finally equal in hell—as far as I could tell at least. 

“What did I do to deserve this?” I asked with gratitude in my heart. Life for me was suffering. Life for me was hellacious—certainly not rivers of blood, that is hyperbole—every waking moment was struggle and strife. In death, I finally found rest. 

“We have all earned our place,” said Baz. “Through means and methods private and peculiar, we have each turned our backs on God. We live out eternity in this place as punishment.”

I scoffed at this remark. It was not I who turned my back on God. He had turned his back on me. 

My parents raised me to believe that if I performed acts of righteousness, if I was kind to the downtrodden, if I prayed every day and attended church every Sunday, I would be blessed. I was owed a blessing by virtue of being a messenger of the good word. 

The prosperity gospel. 

Hogwash. All of that. I wasn’t blessed a day in my life. I was given no quarter by life, no hand extended by my neighbor, no bootstrap ever strong enough to support my weight—and later in life, no boot ever dry enough to warm my feet. No. I was never extended the same kindness I had paid out early in life. I slowly faded into the background of the city, a fixture lacking focus, a set piece never illuminated by the spotlight of life. At best I was ignored, at worst I was beaten. Although, that beating led here. So maybe it wasn’t the worst thing to have happened to me. 

I looked Baz up and down. He looked me directly in the eyes—I couldn’t remember the last time I had experienced a gaze intent and intentional. 

“Can you show me to my living quarters?” I inquired. 

“It’s not far from here. Follow me,” said Baz as he turned toward a large gray building. 

I followed behind Baz and continued to breath in my surroundings. My stride was long, prideful for the first time. I eagerly anticipated a roof over my head. What luxury awaits. As I strode along, I noticed the furtive glances of neighbors and demons alike. Perhaps it had been some time since they had seen a face so content. In my view, there was nothing to fear, there was nothing to fret. I would have a place all my own, a bed to sleep in, nourishment and leisure time. 

This was a veritable paradise.

“Here is your quarters,” said Baz as he pushed open a beige door with the number 1129 on it. We had climbed 11 flights of stairs—apparently elevators do not exist in hell—and yet I wasn’t breathing heavy in the slightest. My physical health was the best it had ever been. 

I scanned the room with a grin wide on my face. To many, the space was nothing special. To me, it was palatial. A twin bed tucked in the corner, topped by one pillow. A small desk opposite the bed, a solitary lamp shown upon a note book and pen. The window had no dressing, but looked out upon the gray expanse of the cittern below—I could see into another building across the street from mine. 

“Thank you, Baz. This will be just fine,” I said as I walked over to the bed and laid down. I stared at the ceiling and closed my eyes. The bed was firm but cradled my body in a matter that felt at once foreign and maternal. 

“Before I leave, I should note,” said Baz, “there are many trials and tribulations which await you in this place. Each trial is an opportunity afforded to you to earn ascension into the eternal realm of heavenly light. You would do well to make the most of these trials and work over the millennium ahead to earn your place among the chorus of angels in the court of heaven.”

I sat up and gave Baz the toothiest grin I could and said, “I’m already here.”

""Why would the afterlife punish good people by sending them to Heaven?"" He said rubbing his eyes in frustration. He took a sip of his mojito - set it back down. I paused and as I watched the glass refill itself, I tried to think of way to get this conversation back on track. 

""Look"" I said ""the religions down there tell us that if we do bad things like murder, steal, rape we go to Hell. Where we are tortured for eternity. If we do good things like go to church/temple/mosque, pray, live by the Bible, the Quran etc we go to heaven to be rewarded.""

The demon shook his head, ""you are speaking nonsense. If you murder, steal, rape than you go to heaven. Where else would you face judgement? The almighty doesn't have time to commute, you go straight to them and they deal with your punishment. That's their whole deal. Obey the laws I laid down or face my wrath. How could bad people face their wrath if you don't go where they are?""

As I processed that mindfuck, he continued ""what do you mean religions? And pretty much every word you said after that?"" 

I look at him, shocked, look around, sure somehow this is all some sort of great cosmic joke. There is nothing to interrupt my views of paradise, or interrupt my thoughts apart from the gentle trill of birdsong off in the distance. I look back him, look into his eyes and seeing genuine confusion. I go on to explain the world's religions to him. 

Many many mojitos later he has taken to just rolling about with laughter. The only words I have had put of him for the last few hours have consisted of ""They said what? People believe that? They do what? Why?""

The topic of sex particularly left with tears streaming down his face in laughter. ""Seriously, come on your pulling my leg? Why would the almighty not want you to enjoy the bodies they created for you? They created you in their images, why would you not enjoy the blessing they gave you? How did anyone convince you all that it was wrong? Jeez you guys can't be doing it right, if you think it's a bad thing"" 

Then of course I have to go on and explain that it's not the act per se but the sin, the shame, the guilt. Both of which are completely foreign concepts to him. 

""Oh man, someone has done a right number on you mortals, you have got some seriously big issues. It does explain a few things though..."" He trails off looking into the distance.

""What?"" I question

""Well"" he says looking a bit embarrassed, ""I only actually the new guy, your my first arrival."" He sees my start at that and hurries on ""It's not that I don't know what I doing, I have done the full 1000 years training, and got top scores for my year. I just didnt get why you humans all seems to go a bit crazy for a bit when you first get here. But it kind of makes sense now.""

""Didn't they tell you any of this?"" I ask

He shakes his head and shugs, ""I would never had believed it if they had. Not sure I do now, hearing it straight from the horse's mouth, it's a lot to take in.""

""Tell me about it!"" I say ""My whole world, no universe view just got totally blown apart.""

He looks sheepish, ""Yeah I guess it's worse for you. But come on sounds like it was all for the best really.""

He stands up and gestures me to follow, ""come on you have the whole of eternity to process that shit. What do you want to do first?""

I smile, ""The Fiery Pits of Hell?""

The people and atmosphere are a lot nicer than you are used to and there is no stress or pressure.

Asked the demon.  ""What does that lava pit over there with the people screaming in agony?""

""What you mean that pool and hot tub?"" I replied "" just looks like people splashing around playing volleyball.""

""What???? That's not possible and how are you not feeling the pain of the searing heat."" The demon demanded.

""I mean it's kinda warm but only in the sunlight those. The shade from those willow trees looks comfy though.""  I said walking over.

The demon chasing after me and exclaimed ""those are geysers of molten lava not weeping willows!""

Before I could reach them the demon ran in front of me and blocked my path.

""Here hold this"" they said while handing me the most beautiful diamond.  Shinning so brilliantly that it seemed to produce the light rather than reflecting it.

""Omg look at this thing."" I said holding it to my eye. "" it's like there is a rainbow inside.""

""WHAT!!! That is a ball of smoldering coal!"" Stamping their foot in disgust.

""Hey dudes look at this"" I yelled walking over to some  people who appeared to be sitting on some picnic tables talking.  

As soon as they saw it I could see wonder in their eyes.""it's beautiful why have I never noticed this before.""

One of the people began crying ""if only I had seen sooner there is so much I could have done around here!!!""

""I know right. when did we get a spa?"" Said a middle aged man wiping what appeared to be soot off his clothes.

""NO NO NO!"" Raged the demon.  ""You're infecting them!!!""

""Whoa an angel!""  Exclaimed a child who was using the diamond in a game of catch with some other children.""

""I've never seen one with black feathered wings before.""  A woman carrying an infant said walking up to the demon.  ""I'd like to file some complaints.  Why have we been here so long but not allowed to use these public amenities?""

""What!! There is nothing but pain and suffering here!  Even if we had anything like that it wouldn't be 'Public'.""

""That sign right there by the pool says 'For public use.   For service call (666)555-3146'."" I said. Reading the sign to the demon.

Rubbing their eyes the demon screamed in terror ""oh no I can see them now too!!! What have you done to me!"" Before flapping it's wings and flying away.  

""I'll be back and you'll be sorry!""

""OKAY!"" I yelled back ""Don't forget to bring a supervisor!!!""",177,ph30nix01,2022-12-26 17:00:53

You're not Anabelle,"" the image of the ethereally-beautiful and pale figure declared.

""No I'm not,"" I said through gritted teeth. ""Explain why you know my daughter.""

""You must be her father. I see. Where is Anabelle?""

""No, no, I'm the one asking questions. Who the fuck do you think you are?"" I snarled.

The delicate eyebrows of the Moon Goddess furrowed gently. ""That's not an appropriate tone-"" she attempted to chide.

I barked in harsh laughter, interrupting her. ""Like hell it isn't! I have half a mind to smash this thing right now! Only reason I haven't already is because Annie begged me to at least talk to you first. So talk.""

The Moon Goddess sighed and smoothed her far-too-sheer dress. ""I'm glad Moon Warrior Anabelle is well. What did she tell you?""

""She told me enough,"" I said. ""She told me that this gem thing basically turns her into a superhero to fight the, what did she call it?""

""The Shadow that lurks in the hearts of men?"" she offered helpfully.

""Yeah, that. Makes people into monsters. You have my daughter fighting goddamn monsters!"" I shouted. ""What's wrong with you?""

""What's wrong, sir, is that I've been sealed away from the Earth, unable to protect it. People are dying. Your world will fall under the Shadow if nothing is done,"" she said, limpid eyes imploring me.

But I was unmoved. ""One of those people could by Annie,"" I said. ""This is wrong. Why her?""

""Only those with love in their heart, pure and true, could hear my call. Your Anabelle answered. She recognized the threat posed by the shadow. She is a remarkable girl.""

""I know,"" I said quietly. I thought hard. ""You said those with a pure heart could hear you, but I can hear you now. What's different?""

""You have a Moonstone, one of five that I could create. It allows our connection and allows me to transform Anabelle into a Moon Warrior,"" she explained.

""Would it only work on Annie?"" I asked.

The Moon Goddess pondered a moment. ""I suppose not. After all, you can reach me with it. But the user's love must be pure and burn bright, or else the Shadow will defeat you.""

I nodded grimly. ""Believe me, Moon, a father's love definitely burns bright. Annie's not going to fight for you anymore. I'm taking her place as Moon Warrior Dan. And I'll be talking to the parents of any other kids too. Take it or leave it, but nothing, no goddess and no shadow, will endanger my kids!""

My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.

""Molly."" I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.

""Molly!"" I yell this time.

""Hello."" I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. ""I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother.""

""I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?"" I ask, trying to control my own voice.

""I am the night.""  
""Where's Molly?"" I say again.

""I said, I am the night!"" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. ""I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves."" 

I roll my eyes. ""Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!""

""She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side.""

I stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.

""Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant."" I yell. 

""I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . .""  
I cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.

""She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job.""

""College?"" The moon goddess pauses. ""College?"" She croaks. 

""Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history."" Please not art history, I think.

""Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?"" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.

I shake my head. ""NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way."" 

""She doesn't know how to fight evil?"" The moon goddess asks.

""NO!"" I scream. ""Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!""

I take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink. 

""Her hair!"" I yell into the locket.

""Sorry."" The moon goddess is gone. The lights go out and I take one step back to turn the lamp on.",217,ThisWeekNeverEnds,2023-01-11 13:44:34

Easy as that. There’s a goddess on the other line, the kind of woman that you know is unspeakably beautiful just from the sound of her voice. There are no metaphors or similes. Some things simply are.

I look out the kitchen window at my daughter, and I want to be furious.

A few minutes ago I was. She came home bleeding. Lily, my little girl. She’s fourteen, her birthday was in August, and though she’s tall for a girl her age I still remember sweeping her into my arms. Pinning her hair. Teaching her how to tie a ribbon—she loved blue and purple, never pink. Was clear about that, always.

Now bruises peek at me through the cuts in her jeans, and every few seconds she puts a finger to her bloody lip and winces, as shocked that it can still hurt like that.

She hasn’t seen me watching her, yet.

“What are you, really?” I say, whispering to the locket in my palm. I’ve twined the silver chain around my fingers and squeezed it until my fingertips started to lose feeling. The locket is shaped like a full moon, pockmarked, and through the holes—blasted all the way through the moon’s silver skin like bullet holes and exit wounds—I can see that the locket is completely empty. But of course it would be. That’s how this works. Everybody knows.

“Luna,” says the Goddess. “And you?”

“Her mother.”

“Ah.”

Lily came home late tonight, the first time she’s ever done that. Snuck into her bedroom to change her clothes. Rummaged through the fridge. I heard the microwave beeping from the bedroom, where I’d laid awake for hours, waiting. I heard the screen door open, close, and I found this locket by the microwave. Lily was already in the garden by then, a cup of instant ramen tossing steam into the autumn air. It’s midnight, and the full moon tracks across the sky. Clouds pass between them, but somehow Lily is always in its light.

“Is she in danger?” I ask.

“Yes,” the goddess says.

“I should hate you,” I say.

“Why?”

“Because she’s just a girl.”

Laughter, another sound without comparison. “And there’s no danger anywhere in that?”

I sway silently, remembering. Lily finishes her ramen. She leaves the cup in a flower bed we’ve been preparing for the winter. The trees are bare, the wind blows her straw blond hair. She’ll catch a chill, I think.

“Fuck you,” I tell the goddess.

“Shall I retract my gift?”

Lily goes back for the ramen cup, crushes it down, forces it into a pocket. She’s been trying to be more serious about littering. She gazes up at the moon. She shivers. I shiver. I press the locket against my cheek. The metal is shockingly cold, the kind that almost tips you back over into drunken, insensate warmth. In that moment I have power. I want to pull Lily back inside, press a cup of hot tea into her hands, wrap her in a thousand blankets and strap her into bed for the next four years, give or take. I want to introduce her to joys of libraries and church socials. Enroll her in the chess club. Send her to school for something sensible like nursing, or maybe encourage her to indulge her love of children and become a teacher. There’s a path unfolding in front of my eyes where I do exactly that. Protect. She leads a very safe, occasionally pleasant life.

Lily sits down in the grass against a tired elm. A shaggy carpet of fallen leaves surrounds her, and she gathers them to her like a blanket. There have been bags beneath her eyes lately to go with the fresh bruises. I lean forward, and suddenly the glass between us sharpens. Magic. I can see her like we’re only a few feet apart; like I’m not her mother, watching from a distance.

Bloody lips quirk. She smiles.

“She understands?” I ask. “The danger?”

“As much as any little girl could,” the goddess says.

“Alright,” I say. “Just be honest with her. Please.”

""Always,"" the goddess says, and I choose to believe her. Sometimes that's all that we can do.

Time passes. I set the locket by the microwave where I found it. Gather up all the comforters that I can find. It’s October after all, and nights here can be cold.

In the morning Lily wakes beneath a cozy heap of blankets. I have a pot of coffee brewing. Fresh muffins cooling in a tin.
