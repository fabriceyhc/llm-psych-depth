Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings.  Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask.  I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.  

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation.  I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like.  A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for.  The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right.  Something was missing.  That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense.  There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand.  It was truly a marvel of technology.  Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny.  Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries.  A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface.  His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did.  I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight.  And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well.  A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

I doffed the NerveGear, and made my way into Kayaba Akihiko's sun-drenched world...",219,Obtuse_Mongoose,2023-02-17 20:57:55

They were both vampires and more importantly, best friends going back nearly 300 years now. It wasn't unusual for one to not hear from the other but it had been weeks now without his friend answering his letters. Normally they wrote one another every few days. It was unusual to say the least.

Elric feared the worst and tred cautiously in the night. Razmat was not always the most careful and hunters were always coming up with new ways to track their kind. He first checked the mailbox. It was overflowing with junk mail and his letters. Not good. Not good at all. He peered into one window and then the next. No signs of Razmat still. He briefly decided leaving, but Razmat had risked his life for him too many times. If this was a trap, Elric would just have to kill the wretched hunters who had stolen his friend from him.

Elric steeled his nerves and then procured the spare key Razmat has always kept hidden under the dirty red and white garden gnome closest to the door. He made a note to chastise his friend again on the pathetic hiding spot should he seem him once more.

With a careful twist of a key and knob he stepped inside. He could feel the adrenaline spiking in him. His whole body tensed. Ready to flee or fight he called out in a hushed voice, ""Razmat!"" Nothing. ""Razmat, you old fool!"" Nothing. Then he heard it. A soft cry or perhaps deathrattle.. ""Ahhhhhhhh.."" It was Razmat. He was still alive. The sound had come from the library located just behind the door atop the stairs. 

Elric would not give the hunters a chance to hear him or finish the job if there was still time. He barred his fangs, and with great vampiric strength and speed exploded through the door. Razmat was seemingly alone and lying on the floor under some kind of heat lamp and a device on his head with two devices strapped to his wrists. Clearly some kind of torture or magic from the hunters. ""NO! Razmat! Speak to me! Who did this to you?!"" 

Razmat yelped in surprise and took off his VR headset, ""Wha? Elric? What are you- What happened to my door?!"" Elric's face sped through half a dozen emotions. Grief. Fear. Confusion. Relief. Happiness. Embarassment. ""I.. I thought you were in danger. You stopped writing. Your mailbox was full. You were on the ground... What is this device that has snared you?""

""Ohhhh, yes, yes! I'm sorry dear Elric."" Razmat chuckled and looked guilty. ""I guess I have been getting carried away. I had my familiar introduce me to this new gadget called ""Vee Arrr""! It's amazing! Elric, you'll never believe it! Please you must try it!"" Elric eyed his friend warily and took a half-step back, ""If this is a trap Razmat.. Blink twice. I will not rest until I free you."" Razmat just gave his friend a stern look, one a father might give a child trying to get out of trouble with a ridiculous story. Razmat reached out his hand offering the headset to his friend. ""Elric, please. This isn't a trap. It's fun! Put this on.""

Elric sighed and cautiously examined the device. ""Vee Arrr"".. He had heard the term once or twice, he was fairly sure. Neither were known to keep up with the recent trends as some of the younger vampires. ""Okay, Razmat. For you."" With a deep breath he fastened the headset to his head and opened his eyes. Immediate regret. ""GHAST! TREACHERY! LIES! RAZMAT YOU'VE BETRAYED ME! NO! AHHHH!"" He pulled his cloak over his body and then.. Laughter? Razmat was laughing? Wait. He wasn't burning. ""What is this magic?"" Elric stammered. ""This is what I wanted to show you! Vee Arrr! We can live in the daylight again, friend! Through these devices! It's amazing! What sights there are to see! It's all I've done since we last spoke!"" Elric examined the sunlight around him. It looked so much like it did all those hundreds of years ago. He took off the headset and began to weep. ""I know, friend. I know. You get used to it. Slowly."" Razmat began to point at the heat lamps ""Look here, I even have heat lamps to give the sun warmth! It's the full experience! Dry your tears and lie on this mat here."" Elric smiled softly, ""very well."" and put back on the headset. It was a virtual world simulating a nice beach on a sunny day. Elric rested on the mat which was perfectly positioned to be on a beach chair and felt the ""sun"" bask his skin. ""Ahhhhhhh.."" Elric slowly exhaled in a state of bliss. ""You must show me how to get one of these for myself.""",403,DoomGloomAngst,2023-02-17 19:29:09

Admittedly he had the misfortune to fail at both, as given what he now was death would not be an untimely occurrence and he’d have to perish purposefully if he saw fit to do so. 

Still, it was always something to see when society pushed the envelope and created something never before seen, and entertainment had been no less magnificent. Gerry liked simple pleasures when he could find them. Petting the occasional stray cat that wandered onto his property at night was the liveliest of happenings, as he tended to keep away from the small town nearby. It made him feel closer to the earth to allow the forest around his modest cabin to provide sanctuary.

When years become decades and decades become centuries one tends to lose patience for trends and routine becomes a boon. The flow of life blurs together into a fog that always seems more or less the same no matter what changes are witnessed. Films and television had been an interesting development as the entertainment certainly provided a way to pass the time at the very least. Holed up far and away from most civilization Gerry had put off electricity for the longest time until he realized the artificial light could feel warm if the voltage was high enough. It wasn’t a sunrise, but it was something. 

It was easy to miss the warmth and the light if he was being honest; as he had been a farmer's boy something young. The feel of cold damp earth in his hands under the warmth of the sun was nothing but imagination now, and he had long since lost the memory of how pink the sky could be at sunrise. Fires in his wood stove were nice, but the light still wasn’t right. It wouldn’t brighten up the sky and sunbeams wouldn’t shine through the trees at dawn in his cabin, but it was alright. 

Digital media was eventually added to Gerry’s long list of hobbies, though remained near the bottom as simply watching events play out was already a very long tried and true pastime. More engaging activities always caught his interest and held it, and the creation of video games had initially intrigued him simply because it required direct input. 

The initial release of small puzzles created with pixels of light from electricity on a glass screen had been fun enough to follow, so he did for a little while. Every year that passed saw improvements to these generated images, though the advent of color television temporarily distracted him from generated shapes in games, as movies once again took a spotlight.

The sun in those films was always wrong though, always... off in some way. The studio lighting casting improper shadows and unrealistic flatness, paling in comparison to the real thing. It seemed a lost hope that anyone would ever be able to capture a real and proper recreation of the sun. Gerry still kept a small ember of hope smoldering deep in his core that provided comfort on days when he found the world felt a little colder.

It was years later that he cycled through a few hobbies he liked to fall back on when he decided to bite the metaphorical bullet and invest in new technology for his small homestead. The faithful color television had finally crackled a final hum and failed to display a picture. The tiny screen remained a glossy dark mirror that showed nothing but an empty room in the dim glow of the fire. 

Blessedly, it was the dead of winter. Days were brief while nights remained long and the sun dipped below the horizon well before evening properly set in. Heading into town was not ideal, but online shopping never appealed much to Gerry. It was due to the fact that he was genuinely quite old fashioned and still preferred to physically see what he would be acquiring before purchase. 

Admittedly he had been eyeing new televisions for quite some time, though age had tempered his impulses to general practicality at best and desperate longing for old familiarity at worst. Gerry maintained an awareness of technological advances as it would do him no benefit to remain ignorant, but remained skeptical that fifteen years could really make much of a difference. 

Fifteen years had apparently made quite a lot of difference, both in quality and in possibilities to explore. He found himself asking the young man at the counter what all he would need to play this new game with a beautiful sunrise depicted on the back of the case. Gerry left with a shard of hope lodged deep in his chest and a purchase that funded the business owners for the next month.

It ached as he set everything up, the cold metal and wires feeling like they held anything but life in them. He was an old man in the body of someone who had never known age and never would. The cold darkness of mountains and forest all he had known for so long it was all he thought he *wanted* to know.

The light from the screen occupying his living room had been practically blinding when he turned it on, stark white and bright logos disorienting and crisp. It was too sterile and had no depth of color, and it was not a sun but a flare. Still cold and unyielding in its intensity of artificial brightness.

Gerry picked up the controller and was almost hesitant to see what might be waiting for him. The warmth from his fire was smoldering, a hearty blaze reduced to soft crackling and a muted glow. 

Making his digital approximation of self on the screen he dove into the artificial world with an eagerness that could only be described as raw and unburdened. He was someone else on the screen, and it looked *amazing*. So caught up with how people and surfaces were displayed in front of him he almost forgot why he had made the purchase to begin with. Until he saw it. 

There, in a false sky inside a screen of light inside his cabin, was the sun. Rays of dawn were cresting over a mountain top reflecting off the blinding snow and painting the landscape with glorious warmth. This was a world he could enjoy in the light of day. 

If he closed his eyes as the pinks and oranges of the sky lit up his room the warmth of the fire felt akin to sunlight for the first time in centuries, and it was magnificent.",45,Gallifrey63,2023-02-17 22:59:19

The noise sounded like a sigh, mixed with a hiss, yet it was somehow happy at the same time. He stood in his open doorway looking down at the ground, where laid an Amazon delivery. 
Velstat's eyes widened as he studied the small plastic bag. He gazed upon this plastic bag with the same look he gave his prey. This delivery was as equally intriguing. It had arrived a full night early.
 ""How fantastic"" he thought. 

For a moment he was looking, studying the minute details and curves of the bag and its smooth white plastic coating. As it reflected off the dull light above, he was reminded that soon he would know the Sun again. At least, he would know it in higher 3D graphical fidelity than any 3D media before. And the next moment, within an instant, he was  holding the plastic package tight against his chest, his door already closed. 

He slit open the plastic bag with his nail and into his palm fell the new Blood Drinker game. Blood Drinker 3: The Viking.

 Velstat was expressionless as he slid the game into his Xbox 9000. Not only was this game using the newest Puretime rendering software, but it also ran on Matrix-Net Tracing. Truly nothing else could render a normal day as good as this game would. It might even look prettier than the real day. A wicked smile crept across his face at the thought. Ah yes soon he would be playing it. Relishing in the Suns bright touch. Nearly day-dreaming, he thought of how he would soon be moving his character throughout the world, through the day while looking up on the most beautiful Sun ever created. And soon he could look upon this beautiful sun.

 Velstat sat on his couch with the posture of a marble statue. As he picked up his controller Velstat let out a small stifled laugh, which turned into a full on below. He was laughing at God. Velstat had no care for the Sun. He didn't really miss it, in fact he hated it. But this was about beating God at his own twisted game. Velstat would win this battle. 
A small victory in this damnation he thought. 
""Yes...""Looking up towards his ceiling,  ""For about 8 fun hours I will soak up as much Sun as I can. And there is nothing You can do to stop it!"" He snarled the last part out loud, pointing his finger up at the ceiling, towards God.

Velstat had other reasons to play, besides pulling a cheeky one on God of course. He was a fan of the first two Blood Drinker games, but this one would be special. He was very old, so old he didn't remember most of his past. But he remembered enough. He was at one time a Viking. He knew Blood Drinker 3: The Viking was not going to be historically accurate but it seemed fitting that in this show of rebellion against the Almighty,  that the main character  should also be a Viking. Velstat finished off his glass of very Red Wine and pressed play.

The graphics were awing. Even his Vampire eyes were completely stunned at the realism. In game, he moved his character through a forest and he could see as the Sun peaked between the trees. Velstat stepped into the open field, soaking in the beautiful day, marveling at the brightness. When suddenly in real life, he burst into flames.",15,LightBlindsAtFirst,2023-02-18 01:04:54

The color in the sky was getting brighter. Victoria grinned widely as she peered at the screen. It was a ritual she performed in games like this, anticipating the sunrise and then stopping to watch it. A wistful sigh escaped her ancient, youthful lips. It took her back hundreds of years to the last time she watched the dawn. A dawn she took for granted and never realized it would be her last.

""Vikkie!"" A familiar voice called from another room, startling Victoria out of her reverie.

Victoria paused the game and set down her Switch to approach her bedroom door. ""I'm in my room.""

Footsteps. Familiar ones. Anne! ""Cover up, the sun is still getting through some of the windows."" Anne said.

Mindful of how the Sunlight might enter her room she backed away and picked up her robe, wrapping it around her and pulling the hood over her head. The door opened and closed quickly--just enough to let Anne through.

""Okay, it's safe, Vikkie."" Anne said.

Victoria pulled back her hood and looked for Anne. The woman stood a few paces into the room from the door. Following the modern, comfortable fashion, Anne wore a gray hoodie and form fitting jeans. It was distasteful to Victoria--she preferred the elaborate fashions from her time. Fashions that hid more of the shape of the body, but she was working on that.

""Greetings, Anne."" Victoria said, approaching the woman with arms open. Then she noticed the box between them--keeping them from their usual greeting embrace. ""What's this?""

""Hi, Vikkie."" Anne looked down, directed by Victoria's words. ""Oh, it's a present.""

""A present?"" Victoria echoed quizzically.

""Mmhmm! For Valentines!""

""You know I can't have chocolate...""

""It's not chocolate.""

Victoria narrowed her eyes at the package before taking it in her hands and moving to her desk to begin opening the brown box. ""You should have wrapped it."" Victoria noted blankly.

""I thought you said wrapping paper was quaint and unnecessary. 'It serves no purpose.'""

Having removed the tape and started opening the flaps, she looked up at Anne with a steely gaze. ""Well, maybe I just like it. It's pretty.""

Anne giggled and drew closer, draping her arms around Victoria's neck and shoulders and kissed the top of her head. ""I'm sorry. I'll use 'frivolous decoration' next time.""

Victoria shook her head while she removed her gift from a variety of boxes out of the brown box. When it sat on her desk there was what looked to be a dark brick with straps to hold it on the head and wands with rings at the ends.

""What is it?"" Victoria asked, uncertain how to express herself with regard to the odd gift.

""It's a VR headset."" She said, reaching past Victoria to grab the wands. ""And these are the controllers. I told you about VR.""

Victoria raised her brows and pursed her lips. ""The simulated reality device?"" She asked cautiously.

Anne nodded. ""That's right. I know you've been wanting to experience watching the sunrise again... I know watching it as Link isn't enough.""

""Anne..."" Victoria pressed her brows together in a grateful expression and drew Anne's face down with one hand to press a kiss against her cheek. ""Thank you. But... I don't want to experience this without you either.""

""You won't have to, Vikkie."" Anne assured her. She stepped back and slipped her backpack from her shoulders. ""I have my own."" She said as she set her carry storage for her own headset and controllers on the desk. ""I'll be with you.""

They took the time to set up the devices and get into the headsets. They moved into a private VR world together.

""It's..."" Victoria trailed off, astounded by how similar this world was to the world she knew.

""Surprisingly realistic?"" Anne giggled. ""I know. The weirdest parts are the floating menus, aren't they.""

Victoria nodded.

""Are you ready?"" Anne asked, moving close. Blindly, she dropped her controller and took Victoria's hand, interlocking their fingers.

""I'm not sure...""

Taking it as a yes, Anne pointed her controller and clicked the button to initiate the gradual sunrise. Then she dropped the other controller and held onto Victoria. ""I'm right here. You're safe. I'm excited to see this with you.""

A soft croaking noise came from Victoria's throat. Her golden eyes slowly widened as she saw the rays of the simulated sun reaching over the horizon. Though she didn't need to breathe, she often did and now--now she held her breath. It felt like something powerful enveloped her ancient heart and like a wonderful knot of joy was being pulled up through her. As the light of that golden sphere hit her eyes she started to feel warm tears welling up in her eyes. The crimson tears streamed down her cheeks. Overwhelmed with emotion she instinctively sought out Anne's presence and squeezed her hand.

""I'm here. It's beautiful isn't it?"" Anne said softly, squeezing Victoria tightly.

Victoria nodded and sniffled wetly. ""Anne...""

""Yes, Vikkie?""

""Thank you..."" She croaked.

""You're welcome."" Anne replied. ""I love to see your joy.""

""I love you, Anne....""

""I love you too, Victoria.""",24,_SapphicVixen_,2023-02-17 23:08:02

A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter. 

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived. 

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",7,MarshallSorrows,2023-02-18 01:16:10

Sickness and despair, families torn apart, entire economies in shambles. 

A new source of sustenance we were told.  An inexhaustible supply of the richest dreams ever found.  Most sentient species dreamed infrequently and only then short periods. They had evolved from sleep to hibernation where dreams do not exist.  Eons of space flight across galaxies and the time required to get there had forced an evolutionary change on almost all species. 
A few species still existed for us to harvest from but these were simple,  joyless and bland. They brought little satisfaction apart from keeping the pangs of hunger at bay. 

Then I found it. Earth as it is called. 

Billions of sentient beings. Each one with unique dreams as varied as the number of stars. Our process for harvesting was painless and left no trace. And, far as we had determined,  it had no ill effects on the humans.  They had an inexhaustible supply of dreams.  We could sustain our entire populace on less than 10% of this planet.  

Early samples were promising.  So much so that I skipped testing for side effects.  In a thousand millennia we had only ever come across a handful of harmful effects and even then,  it was only when we harvested from a source caught in the event horizon of a black hole. Thier spaghettified minds being torn apart in that unending moment made a few of our species go mad. 

So I harvested dream upon dream. 
I had tried to find dense population centers to harvest for expediency. I only occasionally fed as needed. Two or 3 dreams would be more than enough for my journey home. A child's dream of a sunlit field, birds singing and their pet dog running beside them. It was delightful. 

A young adult male was playing his favorite sport at the highest levels with great success. This one filled me up so much so that I skipped 3 cycles before my next one. 

I think they are called veterans.  
The realization that this human was reliving actual moments they had experienced was unlike anything I had ever tasted.  The fear, self loathing at failing to save a comrade, the unbridled hatred but most of all the sadness.  It was horrible and exhilarating at the same time. I hated myself for it but couldn't stop. It consumed every fiber of my being  I could not live without more of it.  It didn't offer any nourishment or benefit but I could think of nothing else.  I knew I was wasting away,  ignoring basic needs to consume more and more of these nightmares as they were called but I couldn't stop. 

When I arrived at my home world I was near death.  Unconscious,  I was taken to our healing center.  In the meantime my stores of dreams were unloaded and distributed.  I was unable to warn them. 
When the dreams I harvested from what the humans called a VA hospital, were consumed, a riot ensued.  We had never known violence against one another but the need to get more of these dreams was so strong that all reason was abandoned.  It was determined that mature human dreams should not be consumed. 


Not wanting a repeat of the riots the next batch, from young humans was released. From what humans called an orphanage.

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and *bloody*.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, *ever*, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a *nightmare* tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",1203,SirPiecemaker,2022-09-06 09:13:46

Watching as the human laid trapped in a spider’s web, unable to move. Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

 

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldn’t eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes in it.

 

As the spider revealed itself, the human only grew more panicked, making small mumbles in their sleep as they tossed and turned until finally Xai relieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the human’s ears, slowly drifting into Xai’s skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

 

Even after being fed, Xai couldn’t leave the human’s side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mind’s way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

 

Xai took another look into the human’s mind, finding this dream far more realistic. The dream consisting of the human sitting beside a family member, discussing something that appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect example of a brain making sense of things that had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from?
The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alien’s mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

 

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didn’t know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind. Xai hovered above the bed before vanishing in a blink of light, returning to their ship.",330,sadnesslaughs,2022-09-06 08:45:39

“These humans do not just have dreams. They have these horrible, twisted dreams called nightmares, where everything is terrible. I’m returning home.”

The Hexalians anxiously awaited Kashitok, expecting to see a shaken and defeated comrade. When he first appeared, their fears seemed true. His face, once healthily green, approached a brownish colour that would lead many Hexalians to shake their head and mournfully prepare a permanent send-off into the darkness of space.

What was strange, however, was the radiant smile on Kashitok.

“You look positively psychotic,” mission commander Laxok said. “Your expression and your complexion do not match.”

“I know, sir,” Kashitok said. “I think I need a lie down, and a long time in a proper toilet. But I’ll give my report soon.”

After a Hexalian hour of the entire space base trying to ignore the sounds coming from the washroom, Kashitok finally emerged with a much healthier colour.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “I understand if you need more rest due to the harrowing experience.”

“Oh, I actually feel quite good,” Kashitok said. “Refreshed, even.”

“If you say so,” Laxok sighed. “You did well, emissary.”

“Those nightmares,” Kashitok felt his tongue instinctively rub across his lips. “They are strange. It kind of burns your tongue.And your face. Maybe you get a headache.”

“That sounds utterly horrifying,” Laxok said gravely. “I’m so sorry. I’ll henceforth strike off Earth as a potential hunting ground.”

Kashitok held out a hand, shaking his head.

“No, no, no, don’t be. I shouldn’t like it... but I do.”

“What do you mean, you like it?”

The emissary rubbed his chin, gently clicking his tongue.

“Dreams taste... good. They linger on your tongue, makes you happy, and leaves you contented. But...”

Laxok leaned in closer, curiosity turning his face a shade of purple.

“But?”

“Eating a nightmare is challenging,” Kashitok said, smiling manically. “It’s painful, but that’s also what gives it flavour. And that makes me want to eat it more.”

“... You are a sick bastard, Kashitok.”

“I brought a sample back,” the emissary said, putting a small transparent bottle in front of his commander. It was a shifting mess of dark crimson, with streaks of grey and black mingling uglily within it. It shook on the table, like the nightmare was trying desperately to claw its way out.

“That looks disgusting,” Laxok made a face.

“Just a small sip, commander.”

Laxok tentatively reached out, grasping the bottle firmly. He uncapped it, and watched as the nightmare almost desperately reached out into the open air. With his lips towards the mouth of the bottle, he gently tasted the nightmare.

Laxok jumped up immediately, breaking out into an impromptu dance. He slammed the bottle onto the table—which Kashitok immediately capped—and rushed towards a more pleasant dream in his collection. One desperate gulp after gulp, the commander finally calmed down enough to take back his seat.

“Kashitok,” Laxok said. “You are insane.”

“Maybe,” Kashitok said, putting the nightmare fully into his mouth. “But I’m doing the human a favour. They are welcome.”

The gaseous creature travelled from planet to planet gathering the essences of insanity and fantasy from wandering minds of unconscious sentient creatures; their dreams. They floated just above their heads like soft white clouds as absorb the sweet essence from their host.  
But this one, this planet. It was different. It was wrong, so very very wrong.  
When the Greycloud found it’s latest host on a small planet in untravelled space, they saw that the creature was moving it’s head slightly, like he was twitching ever so faintly.  
No, not twitching. It was... squirming. Twisting. It’s breathing was laboured should’ve brought the thought that, had this being not been confined to sleep, it would have been writhing in agony... and fear.  
But, the Greycloud ignored its own subconscious observations. The warning signs were all there, but they all went unheeded. It had always been a glutton, and a fool.  
The Greycloud place itself upon the creatures head, hungry for a meal. It took it’s first taste, dipping it’s own consciousness slowly into the sea that was a sentient being’s mind. One shallow take, it noticed that the dream tasted odd. But it’s helium stomach urged stronger than its logic. It dipped deeper, the dream tasted sour, but it thought that this must be the outside, there must be a sweet center. It dove even deeper, and deeper, and deeper. The dream tasted even sourer and sourer, until finally the Greycloud’s consciousness reached the center core of the slumbering creature’s dream. It opened it’s stomach, and sucked in everything it could. A mistake, a horrible mistake.  
Lighting, hail, and blood rain pulsed through it’s gaseous form as it arched and twisted into unnatural and horrid shapes. As it squirmed in agony.  
Pain and fear burned through the Greycloud’s consciousness. They mixed with pain and fear that was not the Greyclouds own but that of the slumbering creature.  
Visions flooded its mind, but unlike other foragings, these visions were not sweet, were not soft. They were sour, spoilt, and rotting. The unholy taste would have brought out ear piercing screams from the Greycloud had it possess a mouth to scream from and lungs to gasp with.  
But the Greycloud had sent its own consciousness too deep into the slumbering creature’s dream. It could not pull itself out, and for 5 agonizing hours the Greycloud suffered, and when the creature finally awoke, the Greycloud did not even rejoiced, for it had not the energy to do so. It slithered away, back into the cosmos, scarred and squirming with fear.",83,The_Portal_Passer,2022-09-06 12:18:44

Freshly asleep, its denizens knew not of the being from the cosmos sent to feast on their nightly visions.

It crept onto a rooftop, peering into a window of one of the freshly asleep, shifting in bed, eyes darting around under their closed lids. A perfect meal, the being thought to itself, and as such it crept into the victim’s mind, eager to get its fill. 

It soon found itself in a busy city street, moving in a crowd of blurred faces. It sees the victim sitting alone, looking down on the ground as if they were unaware of the being’s presence. Perfect, It thought, as it began its consumption. The distant cityscapes of the dream soon began to crumble, much to the apathy of the dream’s constructs, and the victim themselves.

When the destruction drew near the being, the dream’s blurred constructs all stop in their tracks, beginning to eye the victim in hostile contempt. The visible destruction was soon flooded with a blackened fog, much to the being’s confusion. It wasn’t causing this fog?...

As the rest of their surroundings sink into the darkness, all that is left in front of the being is the crowd and the victim on their lonesome, sobbing on their bench. Sobbing? Dreamers usually never act like that, the being thought. It soon found itself startled by a sudden noise, yelling, coming from the crowd of constructs.

The sounds stank of vitriol. Of hatred. Of fear. The being knew not what those meant in this environment, it just meant to simply consume this dream. Yet it wasn’t budging anymore. The dream wasn’t collapsing, the being wasn’t getting fuller, for it wasn’t a dream anymore. 

It was a nightmare.

The constructs slowly vanish one by one, leaving just the being and the victim, the latter of which continues crying, surrounded by a pitch black void of nothingness. The being, confused, thought its job was done, yet it could not leave. It was trapped in this person’s mind. 

It started becoming desperate, clawing at the dark despite nothing being there. The victim, who has gathered enough of themselves to look up, sees the being in its full form, standing in front of them amidst nothing else. 

Then they screamed. In terror? In rage? It couldn’t tell, but the simply the sensation of such during what’s supposed to be an easy meal was overwhelming. It tried to flee, but it found itself crashing into a wall of the cityscape, which has reappeared. Looking up, the being saw that the sky had been replaced with a drab, maroon glow, and the buildings looked long abandoned, filled with mysterious red stains and with greenery, slowly creeping up the towering heights of their massive walls. 

The victim falls onto their knees from their seated position, arms outstretched. They have ceased their screaming, allowing the being a bit of breathing room. It didn’t know what was going on. 

Then, one by one, the buildings around them burst into flames. The victim breathed heavily, looking up, a look of fear in their eyes. Though they did not react to its presence, the being felt as if it was in danger. It tried to flee through the city, yet the flames kept spreading far faster than it moved soon, it found itself having looped back to the victim, still on their knees. When it turned around to find another path, it finds that the flames have surrounded the both of them, inching ever closer.

Still not accepting its fate, the being tried to interact with the victim, who simply did not react. As the flames engulf the two, the being could not do more than mirror its target’s terrified expression.

Poof. The being found itself on the same rooftop it had entered the dream from, looking down at the quiet streets of the peaceful night. In a panic, it looked around in as many places as it could, yet there was no fire. The sky was black, and the buildings looked as maintained a ever. It was confused.

For the rest of the night, the being sought out no more dreams. Even though it hadn’t had its fill, such an experience was something it would not like to relive. Ever....",116,Youhoooop,2022-09-06 08:21:14

It was just black.
Looking around, it seemed at first as if this one was simply not dreaming. 
How long was he on earth now? Three weeks? Four? He encountered all sorts of dreams; some delightful, some naughty, some plain, but all delicious.
But what is wrong with this one?

He couldn't tell one, but at a certain point, the blackness became liquid, and he was floating in it. Still unable to see something, he tried moving, feeling relieved that he could now control his body - or his dream spirit, to be exact. It was what he used to consume dreams, by sending it into the mind of the creature and draining the dream from inside. 

At some point, he began to see something on the horizon. Some kind of blob, protruding from the vast blackness that covered everything. Moving towards it, he began feeling as if the world was fighting against him, the liquid flowing in the other direction and the shore, as he realized later, getting father away. He was not about to give up, until the blackness around him took the shape of many hands, the did all they could to drag him under the surface. 

Fighting with all his might, a sense of dread washed over him, as his face was finally submerged, and he was dragged down, farther and farther, unable to resist.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

He shot up in his bed, sweating bullets and panting heavily as he clutched his stomach, a nasty twisting sensation welling in the pit of his belly. He hurried to the restroom, only to vacate his stomach contents into the bowl while shaking periodically.

""So you had a nightmare?"" 
""A nightmare?"" He asked, his co-worker's reacting baffled. 
""Yes, a nightmare. A scary dream, a fear of yours that you knowingly have or just discovered, a nightmare."" He concluded. 
""What a terrifying concept..."" He mumbled under his breath, looking at the office window. Humans were terrifying, scarier than any species he'd come across in the explored universe.

Turns out humans are the only sentients in the galaxy that have nightmares.,,3772,2022-09-06 07:27:48,incxlw4,"My host was a female named Heather. She was middle-aged and lived alone in a small apartment in a small city. Her apartment was drab and dreary when she was alone, but it would become full of light and warmth when her friend came visiting. Her bed was soft, and I liked when Heather would curl up on it. There was a large window in the apartment, and the sun would shine on us when we rose each morning. Heather worked in a cubicle at a large building on the other side of the city. The building was large and imposing, but it had wide windows and it was filled with light, even on cloudy days.

Heather had a few friends who visited her sometimes. One of them was named Sandra. She was pretty and nice, but she didn't make Heather laugh like some of the others did. Another one of her friends was named Frank. Frank was always kind to Heather, and he made her laugh with his antics. Heather's boss, a man named Jeff, also visited her sometimes. Heather did not like it when he visited though she would hide it from him as he lead her into her own bed.

Heather would go to bed early most nights, and then she would have nightmares all through the night.

Some of the nightmares were confusing, with a glowing man standing at the foot of her bed, or a beautiful woman walking through her apartment. The best ones though were the ones where Heather was caught up in a terrible storm. She would be walking down a dark street and would start to hear thunder. Then she would see lightning flash, and she would start to run. The lightning would come closer and closer, and she would start to hear louder and louder cracks of thunder. Finally, she would turn to see an imposing figure from her childhood, and she would wake up and scream. Some nightmares were more straightforward. She would be in her cubicle at work, and the light would start to fade. The windows would become dark, and the building would become a black hole. Heather would scream, but no one could hear her.

Heather had always been a bit of an outsider. She was never quite sure why, but she always felt like she didn't quite fit in. When she was younger, she would often go on walks by herself. She would walk through the city, or through the park, and she would think about all of the things that she wanted to do.

Heather dreamed of being an artist. She wanted to paint pictures that would make people feel something. She wanted to capture the world around her in a way that no one else could. But she never had the confidence to pursue her dream. So, instead, she worked in a cubicle and went home to her empty apartment every night.

The only thing that made Heather happy was when she was asleep. When she was dreaming, she could be anyone she wanted to be. She could be free from her boring life and fly among the stars. In her dreams, she was beautiful and strong and loved. But when she woke up, she was just Heather again. A lonely woman who was afraid of her own shadow.

But I could not allow Heather to dream anymore for it was her nightmares I had come to feed upon. Her nightmares were my sustenance, and I grew stronger every night.

Soon she knew of course. She knew that there was something wrong with her nightmares. She didn't want to tell anyone, though, because she knew that people would think she was crazy.

But she knew that something was amiss.

And so she started to keep notebooks.

The first one was called ""The Old Man."" The next one was called ""The Big Storm."" The next one was called ""The Chase."" Each dream was different from the last, but they always had the same ending. Me.

One day, as she was leaving work, she saw a flyer advertising a support group for people who suffered from nightmares. She was hesitant at first, but she knew that she had to do something. So one night, she went to the meeting.

The meeting was in a church basement. It was dark and quiet and cold, but it was full of people like Heather. They sat in a circle and talked about their nightmares. Heather couldn't believe that anyone else had the same kind of nightmares that she did. It was like they were all describing the same exact dream. It was amazing.

After a few meetings, Heather learned that the leader of the group was going to be giving a talk on lucid dreaming. He told the group that lucid dreaming was when you know that you are dreaming. He told them that it wasn't a state that you entered easily, but that it could be achieved with practice. He passed out a small booklet, and Heather took one home.

I knew what this meant. Heather and I would meet.

“Sending now.” My palp shakes as I reach for the emergency transmission button, but I manage to press it, sending out a data packet that contains my location in time and space for anyone who can decrypt the signal. I don’t know how many times I’ve pressed that button, as I’ve lost track of the bright/dark cycles I’ve spent on this forsaken rock.

*<What’s the situ... no response from the oth...ncerned.>*

“This place is poison, Kzan! I’ve never tasted anything like it.” I shudder, but only partly from distaste. The rest of the motion is fatigue, despair, and a gnawing sensation in my thorax that used to be hunger but has progressed into something more nebulous. “I haven’t eaten in... nearly a greatcycle, I think.”

*<But we know the inhab...ctivity during subcons—>*

“Yes, they dream,” I snap, “but it’s different. These things... their cycle’s darkness doesn’t stay in their sky, Kzan. It invades their minds, twists their thoughts, wakes their fears. Their dreams are wrong in a way no other species’ have ever been.”

There’s a brief silence. Imprimatur only knows how many of my words are getting through.

“Kzan,” I whisper, shaking, “you’ve got to get me off here.”

I exhale and sink to the floor, resting my dome against the pod’s smooth tiles. Two cycles, and I’ll be safe. Two cycles, and I’ll taste something besides the noxious fumes in the minds of these bipeds.

It isn’t always toxic, that admixture of memory and imagination that overtakes them when the sun disappears, but when you’ve spent your whole life living on nectar, even water stings the throat, and what’s in their minds isn’t water.

Still, I’ll have real nourishment in a few cycles. Perhaps it’s worth it to drink again from that bitter cup, to fill myself before I faint from hunger, even if the draught burns me.

Hesitantly, I open my thoughts to theirs.

I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didn’t expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as “cheering”.

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didn’t beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

“The economy will collapse!” One of them said, his tone identified as ‘condescending’. “If you give everyone homes and healthcare, nobody will want to work! You are just giving everyone a handout!”

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered “motivation”.

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

“Why not?”

“Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,” I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. “You spent one sixth of your day working.”

The young woman looked at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

“We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,” she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. “Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.”

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

“Even the good jobs don’t really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.”

Half? Willingly?

“So... since we are talking here, may I ask a question?”

I nodded.

“Why all the perks?” She sounded sincere. “I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and not having to worry that an ambulance ride will bankrupt me but... I think a lot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.”

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, “catch”.

“There is none.”

“None at all? No eating our young or old?”

“We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.”

“Solving the world hunger, too, huh?” She smiled. “Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.”

“We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.”

“And you are not going to, I don’t know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?”

“Good. Just checking.”

The young woman was soon let go. I stayed in my war room way past the allocated four hours of workday.

We came here as the conquerors.

 Zygol was a wise Questar with many years of experience invading and occupying alien worlds for the good of the empire. With his kind of experience came a knowing smile. 

“Sadol, these humans are cheering because they are used to having overlords. We just happen to be much less harsh than their former masters.” 

Zygol had seen this type of world a handful of times in all his conquests. A world where the people hadn’t become united towards the collective good. One where a select few ruled by exploiting all the rest. 

Most worlds didn’t take kindly to invasion and had to be conditioned for immersion into the Gorfet empire. Most species couldn’t see that the universe was much better united rather than having separate worlds with less access to all the knowledge and technology the strongest empires had to offer. The Gorfetites lived by the idea that the strong should take in the weak rather than leave them independent. 

Sure other worlds could get to the higher civilization levels that the Gorfetites were at, but doing so was a waste of time and resources that could be used for the furthering of all species’ interests. And so the Questars expanded out into the universe conquering planets and bringing order to the chaos of life.

But yes, Earth was the type of planet you hoped to conquer. It was full of a species that was living way below their potential due to factors outside of the majority’s control. It was the type of planet that was begging for change. And welcomed it when it came. 

Sure there were those who tried to hold onto power or who didn’t take kindly to the new way of life, but most recognized the countless benefits being part of the empire brought. 

Saldol and many of the newer Gorfetites didn’t understand this type of world because it was so foreign to what they would typically see. Despite what other planets might say the empire was not cruel or evil. 

They carefully calculated how to best use each new planet while still allowing each individual the chance at a fulfilling life. Every position within the empire was available to each species member provided they were deemed capable of fulfilling their tasks. Many people from other planets have been responsible for key breakthroughs in several fields of understanding. The Gorfetites did not consider themselves to be any more important than any other planet they had conquered.

In studying Earth and preparing for its takeover it had been determined that each able human should work 4 hours a day 4 days a week in order to best support the empire. They would be required to work in a field an algorithm helped pick for them with opportunities to switch positions when deemed acceptable. 

They would start work at age 25 and work till they turned 45 with opportunities for further breaks based on reasonable factors. Those who held more specialized or who put in additional time would earn credits which could be used for different perks. 

At a minimum each human would have access to comfortable living conditions and adequate food, health and entertainment options. 

It was the perfect system for a species so used to being given the short end of the stick, but not for one with a more equal people. So yes the humans cheered when their eyes were opened to new possibilities. Because to them this was way better than any future they probably would have known. They had no idea what could possibly be better.

Nothing was lost in translation. 
Our sense of time was in sync.

No more bickering over pride

A teleprompter like device soon displayed the following: “And there is a minimum of two wives required with a full two days of breeding, one for each, no labor on these days. ”

The aliens looked at each other for a moment.
“riricjCCHHHHHH!”

“FUCK YEAHHHH!”, the males in the crowd yelled. 
The aliens shuddered at the thought that these creatures enjoyed forced procreation. The most painfully cruel act for their species. 
There was but few rules left. They had to fear us with these next few, they thought. There is no power without fear and fear is bought with pain. 
“wiWskxkdk~*,£<#SSSSNIPERWOLF{}}#”
The teleprompter churned out: “All humans will now be FORCED to live in a 1 bedroom 3,000 square foot house.” The whole west and east coast of every civilized nation erupted with joy. Cheers and cries of laugher.

They continued:

The crowds of humans each gathered around their center of cities and towns roared with enthusiasm. They began chanting: “WELCOME TO EARTH!” 
Frustratingly the aliens watched as their soon to be conquered planet seems to revel in their new decrees. They knew this reign would not last. That impudence and horror awaited them. The last thing they uttered “Ye3zY” was translated and placed on screen: “We’ll be taking our leave now. Sorry to have bothered you. Please forget this ever happened.” Their spacecraft darted into the ever expanding black æther. Into the nothingness. Everyone paused. The silence.

**Ameth-ta had ten thousand eyes, and every last one of them was weeping.** Rashe-son-del slammed a tankard of fermented souls into its three-lobed maw, drunkenly cursing. That Which Seeks offered Ameth-ta a sheet-shaped cloud of interstellar dust; Ameth-ta noisily blew its nose upon its projection in exospace, thanking That Which Seeks as an afterthought.

It was a funeral for a god, and everyone had arrived.

""I'd—*hic*—I'd like to thank you all for coming,"" Rashe-son-del slurred out. ""The Devourer was many things to us. A friend. A lover. A nightmare made flesh."" The assembled deities rumbled in approval. ""When we first got word that The Devourer's soul-planet had developed life, I'd like to think that nobody was happier about it than The Devourer itself, may its soul blaze on.""

""Hear, hear,"" Ameth-ta rumbled.

""But when that life metastasized—when it warped the planet so much that ol' Devvy started to sicken and die—did they listen when we told them to stop? No! They just clutched their ears and screamed as their internal organs liquefied from the deific pressure of our voice. And when we tried to force them into behaving—""

Here, Rashe-son-del took another swig from its tankard before sundering it from reality with a thought. ""The spiteful fuckers didn't even try to fight us. They knew they couldn't touch us. No, they turned their weapons on their *own fucking planet*. Ruined it beyond repair and took Devvy with them.""

Ameth-ta wouldn't stop sobbing. That Which Seeks handed it another nebula.

""They paid the price, of course."" Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, where the still-cooling remnants of a shattered planet orbited around a flickering star. ""No clue where they evacuated to. But we'll find them. We'll find them and make them pay for what they did to ol' Devvy.""

The assembled deities roared in agreement—

And then Rashe-son-del froze mid-sentence, doubling over as if struck by a cosmic baseball bat.

""What?"" The eldritch entity from beyond humanity's universe opened and closed its mouth in incomprehension. ""How can—who dares—""

That Which Seeks vomited, its body quavering and unravelling, and Ameth-ta shrieked as its thousand eyes began to blacken and close. In a flash of understanding, Rashe-son-del peered into soulspace, at the distant star cluster where its soul-planet laid.

Where its soul-planet *had* lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

""No,"" Rashe-son-del whispered, disbelieving. ""You abominations. You monsters. Was one of us not enough? Must you take *everything* from us?""

As if in spiteful response, the star itself that Rashe-son-del's soul-planet had once orbited dimmed, once.

Then it erupted in a supernova an aeon before its time, and Rashe-son-del screamed in agony as its soul-planet was rendered nothing more than subatomic particles.

""But how... how did they find..."" That Which Seeks struggled to rise, to peer into soulspace once more. It should have been impossible. A needle in a haystack. There should have been no way for the humans to find their soul-planets... unless...

As That Which Seeks unraveled, its mind finally sighted upon the answer. There was no need for the humans to know *which* planet served as the eldritch deities' soul. Not with what they'd done.

One by one, across the cosmos, stars flared bright before winking out forever. And one by one, the gods they'd sustained did too.

“I hadn’t heard that Mrs. B, thank you,” said Mr. A, and he loaded his pipe, puffed absently, watched the blue-gray smoke as it curled up into the eaves.

“It’s true,” Mrs. B went on, voice warbling, her eyes dark and acquisitive, red rimmed like a magpie’s. “They say that God went back to Earth—you know the one—meaning to apologize. He’d forgotten something, see, and it caused quite some trouble. Only—and this is the really unbelievable part—they didn’t recognize him! Can imagine that? God, unrecognized! I should think it would be obvious to anyone on account of the...”

She gestured vaguely, and Mr. A nodded. He wished that she would leave him to his pipe, and the birds. The real ones, who were singing very prettily right now, down the gently sloping field of green, green grass, and beyond that, in the wheat that grew up wild on the edges of his property, before the treeline. But of course, she didn’t. Mrs. B went on warbling for quite some time, until his pipe was empty and that pleasant buzz had worn right off, and all he could think about was that first thing she’d said: *“Some men killed God.”*

Atomics, most likely, and that was his fault. He’d invented them on account of the A in his name, just like he’d invented Apples, Aardvarks, and the Alphabet. A mistake, though not one that he could have controlled. Some things simply were.

And now God simply wasn’t. Why, it took the wind right out of your sail! News like that, other people were sure to overreact.

“But oh, where has the time gone!” Mrs. B was saying. “I have a pie in the oven—apple, if you must know—and Mr. B’s hearing isn’t what it was, sometimes misses the timer. I’m afraid I really must be going...”

“Yes, yes. Away you go,” said Mr. A. He stood to show her out, held her arm politely, kissed her sagging cheek. Watched for a moments as she trundled away towards the trees, knock-kneed and ungainly, half swaddled in a threadbare shawl. A woman old as time itself. Almost as old, in fact, as him.

He spat into the flowerbeds and reloaded his pipe.

So, he thought, God was dead. And he watched as the wind ruffled trees in a place that looked, for no particularly good reason, like a town in early twentieth century Ohio. The neighbors would be out in force by now. Mr. C, D, E, and F. The wives, as inseparable as their husbands, organizing a commemoration of some sort. No doubt why Mrs. B was baking. By the evening Mr. C would come around to ask him to chair the meeting. Formulate a response to the God Dilemma—and how was he supposed to do that, really? Why, they might even ask him to create another Mr. G! They were obsessed with things like that. Appearances. As if they were all slats in the same white picket fence.

Mr. A blew a smoke ring. Contemplated it. Blew another, more complex, like he had all that time ago, and then another,  another, until he blew cathedrals, airplanes, mountains. He blew smoke rings until the sky began to darken, and he saw Mr. C there, coming towards him across the field. Mr. C was tall and thin, and wore a little woolen flatcap and a corduroy suit, patched at the knees and elbows. After dinner he smoked fine cigars or played cribbage with the ladies, and on occasion he had been known to brew a very pleasant sort of brandy that had been introduced on Earth as—what was it now?—ah yes, cognac. In a few moments, Mr. C would clumping up onto the porch and ask him to address the God Dilemma, and quite simply Mr. A was too tired for all that.

Mr. A blew away his smoke cathedrals, and decided that he didn’t want to hear God’s name for a while. A thousand years, perhaps, or more. And if he ever made another, filled out the neighborhood, perhaps he’d skip that letter. Go on to make H’s, I’s, and J’s. Evidently there was something wrong with G. G promoted delusions. Mr. A didn’t quite understand that, and thought he never would. There was something terribly illogical about the impulse to godhood. Why the man couldn’t be content here, among pristine fields and gently rolling hills, with apple pies, and airplanes, and aardvarks, he just couldn’t fathom.

Mr. C clumped up onto the porch and sat beside him. He lit his cigar and began to smoke, which was a bad sign, because it was still too early for him to have eaten dinner. They blew smoke rings towards the setting, and the rings edges blurred away in questions, and though neither of them were sad, precisely, there was nonetheless something bittersweet between them. Left by Mrs. B? Perhaps. Regardless, they just sat silent for a while, until Mrs. A called her husband to dinner.

“Well, Mr. C,” Mr. A said, “it’s been fine.”

“Hey now, just a moment,” Mr. C said.

“After dinner, how about?”

“I think now, Mr. A,” Mr. C insisted.

“Just a minute, love,” Mr. A called out. His wife’s face appeared in the window, still striking after all these years, and then disappeared.

“This God business is very bad,” said Mr. C.

“Mr. D should never have invented death,” said Mr. A.

“Or delusion.”

Mr. A nodded sadly. “Or delusion.”

“But now we are left with a problem,” said Mr. C.

“Are we?”

“Of course. There are eight billion...shall we call them people? Eight billion people out there, spinning on some damn misshapen bit of *rock*, and now they’ve killed their creator.”

“And?”

“And I think we owe them something,” said Mr. C.

“Another Mr. G?”

“Why, yes.”

“You will, of course, explain,” Mr. A said flatly.

And Mr. C puffed a while, while the sun set, and a fine dinner grew quite cold.

“It goes like this,” he said at last. “For all these years, God—Mr. G—had this project. And at first the project didn’t work. He made it and remade it, over and over and over, kind of like you’ve built this house, with your own lips and hands, blown out of so much smoke, until it took a piece of himself. His sanity, unfortunately, but well. It almost worked. Mr. G went down among all these people and became the ten thousand faces of God, gave them a few rules, and now look them.”

“Yes,” Mr. A said, “they have atomics.”

“And whose fault is that?”

“I’m not on trial here.”

Mr. C snorted, tendrils of smoke issuing from his nose.

“But don’t you see?” he said, “it was working. They were becoming, if not real people, then a kind of echo, sometimes pleasant. But now in a fit of terror they’ve killed off their own morality.”

“I wasn’t aware that I’d created a Mr. M,” Mr. A said.

“Oh come off it,” Mr. C said. “You know what I mean.”

“No, I don’t,” Mr. A said. “We’ll those Earthmen go a little while and see what they do. If they’re people, truly, they won’t need a God for their morality. I’d like to think it’s set in a bit deeper than all that.”

A thoughtful expression passed across Mr. C’s face then. “You think a God isn’t necessary for morality?”

“Of course,” Mr. A said. “I’m perfectly moral, aren’t I?”

The front door creaked open, and Mrs. A peered out. “My love,” she said, “I know that time passes differently for you, but unfortunately some of us are still wedded to it. The aardvark has grown quite cold, and I am going to be bed. Mr. C, dear, don’t worry. I’m not mad at you.”

And the door closed on silence, stretching out towards a starless sky and smoke ring clouds. Mountains, rivers, oceans, dissipating where Mr. A had blown them, until they hung ghosted in distance like someone else’s dream.

Mr. C patted him on the knee. “Why, I thank you Mr. A,” he said, “that was quite an illuminating conversation. I’ll have to think on it a while.”

“Mind you do,” said Mr. A. “Now if you’ll excuse me...”

“Yes, yes,” said Mr. C. “Goodnight, my dear man.”

“Good night.”

Mr. A watched until the other man disappeared. He went inside and picked at the cold roast aardvark, drank a glass of that fine cognac. He looked in on his wife, who was asleep, and thought about when he had first made her. Blown her out of so much smoke.  These gently curving wisps, sensual before the word, that had set his blood to boiling. And now.

He went back onto the porch and packed his pipe again. Thought a while about godhood and delusion, a whole host of other things.

Then he went to sleep, right there on porch, with his pipe perched unlit between his lips.

And perhaps the world trundled on.

And how do you put words to such *things* that dwell in those places?

But Things do exist there. Things that do not need words. Do not want or use words.

Things that *defy* words!

I write these words out of compulsion, driven to it by a need I do not share despite the fact that I know this. I feel that I must write what I am being show or I will never be free. I am a prisoner to these horrible images and alien thoughts  bind me. That eat at my mind and soul, wounding me for all time.

In the window behind me the moon languishes green and ripe in the sky. Clouds drift slowly around it as if trying to avoid the moon's rancid touch. As if they know not to cross over the moon or dim its sickly radiance. Clouds tinted with red and orange as the only visible touch of the recent battle against the Deep Ones and the Great Old One, Cthulhu.

The only visible evidence of how bad things had been is the orange and red dust this far from the Pacific coast.

Our atomic weapons had ended that threat and the world rejoiced in our victory. Weapons we had hoped never to use in our earthly wars had been able to turn back those creatures of the ocean floor. Weapons that had remove all traces of them except of the scars we are selves had inflicted on the Earth to achieve victory. Hard-won though the victory was.

So many have lost their lives in that great war with the children of R'lyeh. Far worst are the ones who lost their minds and souls in that battle and still live.

Icy fingers drag across my mind returning me to the task at hand.

To those that know me, if you are reading this - I am sorry. Truly sorry. Tell my family that I love them and hold the thoughts of them close to my heart.

To you others: you may not believe...Rationality and science will push you to discount my words...*but do not!* It will do no good and help you not at all. Ignorance has never been an excuse in our world of knowledge, exploration, and experience. Ignorance is no shield and will not help you in what is to come.

In my vision I see the Darkness opening and embracing our world. Not the darkness of night or closed eyes...or a child's hands over a parent's eyes. No. It is the living Darkness of the Spaces Between where our geometry holds no sway. A Darkness kin to the blind and crawling chaos, a nameless mist that consumes light and fear in it's rangings into our world.

Another resolves itself out of the Darkness but of this one I see little. Eyes as cruel as a predator and crazed as a prophet surrounded by fleshy tendrils that twist and squirm rising out of the Darkness. Huge like some leviathan, a beast hidden in the depths of the ocean but still reaching out for the unwary. Twisting and boiling within the Darkness but not part of it.

Eyes I can not met...Tentacles I fear the touch of...

Something slips away from me, something I value but can not recall...Something...Colours that have no name. Sounds that have no meaning...

...the Mad Arab was right...

A new figure stands in my mind's eye between me and the rest of the vision. Part of it but at the same moment not. It appears as a man the silhouette of a man would most of the time but flipping through guises like the spinning of a mad Ferris wheel moving too fast to enter. Images glimpsed mercifully briefly as I feel them twist my mind and cause my body to rebel. A silhouette of seething and rippling shadow like oily water as the visages it wears are shown to me.

Of one thing I am certain, It's name is imprinted on me as the source of the vision!

The general mumbled ""scientists..."" and skipped ahead a few minutes on the video.

"" as such, using the cultists own methods, we have devised a crude manner of listening in to their 'conversation' that is, while equivalent to trying to watch the string between two cans vibrate from orbit with a magnifying glass, enough to gather meaningful data, enough data to interpret....""

The general skipped ahead a few more minutes until he saw the feed change over to an interrogation room. The usual table and chair setup was gone and instead a naked male body lay on the floor, surrounded by intricate markings and some, luckily for the general, unidentifiable lumps. a microphone was placed near the mouth and occasionally a hazmat suited scientist could be seen moving or removing items from in and around the body. The body itself seemed to have been tortured beyond imagination, cuts and gaping holes nearly covering every inch of skin, and must have been barely clinging to life, but even from a grainy video, the eyes were still disconcertingly active. The mouth began to move and a low voice that seemed to speak words directly into the generals brain, even through the video feed. He noticed his eyes began to water as the voice droned the words, 1 word at a time with sometimes minutes in between.

""It Ceased. Loss. Grief. Understanding.""

The body tried to clasp the hand of the hazmat suited scientist as it emphasised the following word.

""Anger.""

The hand fell back as it went on.

""Cause. Kinetic. Projectile. Many. Fire. Ash."" The body fell silent. After several minutes a voice cut in from off screen, "" Subject 38 has ceased function at 15:41, all brain activity has ceased and vital functions have stopped."" The video ended there.

The general rewound and looked at the body again. From his days as an army surgeon, he too could tell the miniscule difference a body displays when life has completely ended, but the eyes seemed to remain alive.

He opened the second email. This one was marked ""Subject 43"". There was no video attached this time, only a text transcript, that he opened.

""Subject 43 experiment started at 1115, subject female, 56 years old, Ranked High priestess in the Cult Of The Eye, Dr. Raleigh performing interrogation, observing are drs. Whitaker and Boone. Following statement was taken at 2312 hours.

They. Listen.

I. See.

We. Come.

Vital functions ceased at 0129 hours.
The body, while having ceased all vital functions, continued to repeat that last phrase until 0950 hours.

Dr. Raleigh then ordered incineration and cleansing of the room, Dr. Boone seconded. Dr. Whitacker excused due to mental stress.""

The general's eyes flitted over to a note on his desk, Dr. Whitaker had been found hanging from his ceiling fan at 1030 this morning.
He was about to pick up the phone when it rang instead. His hand hovered over the receiver, collecting his thoughts and trying to put a pin in it. 

Before he could even pick it up, the call was disconnected and he could hear the faint, distant sirens beginning to wail again.

His hand instead went to his bottom drawer. That's where he kept his service pistol.

The shot wasn't even heard over the now deafening wail of the sirens, it's entirely possible there wasn't even anyone alive to hear it.",95,SoreWristed,2022-12-12 08:58:57

Unk'Al, Harbinger of Bumping into Things in the Night, lazily opened his single slit of an eye. 'O my.' he gasped in a soft and all too pleasant tone for a massive cycloptic mass of tentacles. 

'What is it, what's wrong?' Inquired Talésh as she perched on a rockformation overhanging Unk'Als basin. 'I haven't heard you this excited for millenia.' Talésh cocked her head and waited for the Eldritch horror below her to respond. 

It took a long moment for Unk'Als gaze to fix on Talésh. When it finally did, Unk'Al shuddered, in as much as a formless tentacle blob can shudder. He'd always found it very disconcerting that the great Consumer, She Who Eternally Hungers, was shaped so much like one of 'realities' pidgeons. Be it quite a bit larger and all together more purple. 'That Which Sees All' is no more, Unk'Al stated curtly. 'I had my feelers on the nexuslines to the human world, The Leer has ended.'

Talésh hopped forward on her rocky outcrop and let the news sink in. 'But.. he is a god, same as us, we don't stop... existing.. do we? We are above death, above time, so how..?' Talésh scampered all the way to the edge and as close to Unk'Al as she could get. 

Unk'Al writhed back slightly. 'Yes..' he said, eye fixed on the figure above him pecking the bare rock. 'Time, yes.. that was it..' drawled Unk'Al. 'The Endless Eye was ofcourse a creature of great.. vision..however he encountered something he did not know. You see in the world of humans time *does* exist, quite firmly so.'

'So?' Talésh rasped impatiently. 'He still wouldn't have died of old age would he?'

Stranger even than her looks, Unk'Al had always found it odd that an eternal creature could be in such a perpetual rush. It was quite undignified he thought. 'No.. but that rock you're standing on apparantly can, or at least their version of rock can.' Unk'Al said vaguely. He did always enjoy pestering the hasted.

Talésh became downright agitated now. 'Rocks can die? From time? What noncence is this?! And even if they could how would that extinguish a god?'

'Well.. everything on our plain is eternal. It is formed and then it simply is. Not so on the human plain.. A great rock, or mountain, degrades with with time. It becomes tiny particles that are course and rough and they blow in the winds. All the more so when humans detonate every bomb they have..They are also almost impossible to get rid of.' an undiscerning bystander might have thought Unk'Al cleared his throat at this moment for dramatic effect. They'd be wrong for the dread lord of uncomforts had no throat. He did however, love a bit of showmanship.

'So, tiny little rocks destroyed something from outside of their realm.. I don't believe you' Talésh stated haughtily.

Unk'Al raised himself up, eye to beak with his fellow Deity from Beyond. 'After a massive bombing the Eye of Terror was caught in a storm of tiny rocks. It got in his eye.'

At this Talésh flapped her purplish wings, cocked her head left and right a few times and finally, slowly responded. 'But... all he was, was a giant, floating eye... I mean his names weren't exactly cryptic, if he got these tiny rocks in his eye he.. he'd have no way to get them out. He'd be doomed!'

'Indeed.' finalized Unk'Al as he settled back and prepared to return to his stupor. 'Eternity has a new tale now, of the rock that was consumed by time and came back to consume the timeless.'",35,001101011100,2022-12-12 12:00:26

Outer Limits

&#x200B;

At the exact center of the ever expanding universe lies an area of space no human eyes will ever see. A rift, or tear, or thinness of space. Like a wound in the skin of our reality through which filters a baleful light. Its color is almost (but not quite) purple. It hovers somewhereon the edges of the human mind’s ability to perceive color. It pulses and flickers as if it were a living thing. Perhaps it is. In that strange space between two universes even a living color seems possible. It is a place of chaos and of madness. A place where the natural laws of reality stretch, skew, and begin to melt into each other like cheese over a plate of nachos.

Somewhere at the center of this nightmarish hell vast, alien consciousnesses lie, suspended between being and un-being. Not dead, but neither fully alive. Vast, swirling clouds of quasi-matter that arrange and re-arrange themselves into aberrant, eldritch shapes. Many mouthed, many tentacled, many eyed. Their very shapes are an abomination. An affront to nature and to sanity itself. From their half-existence in their between-world, these consciousnesses survey our universe. Cool, calculating, alien, overworked, and very, very bored. 

“The fuck you mean he’s dead?” Said a roiling mass of mouths and teeth (and eyeballs with teeth sticking out of them). Its voice was so inhuman that it would have sent the mind recoiling upon itself and screaming into insanity.         

“I mean just what I said.” Responded a massive, crystalline “thing” covered in tentacles and weird little feathery wings.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll just got his ass handed to him. Kaput. Finito. Done dog dinner.” 

The thing paused. Were it blessed with something the human mind could recognize as a face, it would have been frowning. It was not.       

 “Come to think of it, can we even die?”

A vague, slipping/slithering movement from the toothed entity achieves more or less the same result as a human shrug.       

“No fucking clue, mate. Last I checked we weren’t exactly alive to begin with.” 

“I’ve never died before.” A third entity chimes in. It’s hot pink and covered in a sort of mirrored surface that reflects the living light into insane, impossible geometry.             

Gender is not really a construct these entities understand, but even so this consciousness feels decidedly feminine. At least, that’s what it thinks most days, just as it’s getting up in the morning.         

“And what exactly does that add to the conversation, Besst’alt’teh?” Said the second entity.       

“No, hang on, she’s got a point.” Said the first.         

“None of us have died, that’s the whole thing.”         

“I don’t follow.”         

“Isn’t it obvious, Bn’grrghh?” Said the third voice. 

For the most part she did a good job of not letting it show, but she really thought the second entity — to whom the name belonged — was kindof a snobbish prick.         

“Qu’kkor-Bethtll was the resident Elder Thing to that misbegotten planet of fleshies.”         

“And your point?”       

“My point is that now that he’s gone, who’s going to cover his workload?”        

“Jesus fucking Christ, woman. The man’s not even cold in the ground and you’re already thinking of getting overtime off of him?” Spluttered the first entity, whose name was something so impossibly alien that no combination of characters in any known human language could adequately capture its essence.          

The other two just called him Steve.         

“Hey, someone has to.” Said Besst’alt’teh.        

“And, I mean, it’s not like we can just afford to let planets with semi-sentient life go to waste. At least, that’s what management keeps telling us.”         

“You’d figure they’d hire more people if they wanted to cover all sentient life in this shit-pit of a universe.” Said Bn’grrghh with what passed for the equivalent of an exasperated look on what didn’t pass as a face.        

“If you have a problem with making a little extra on your next check, I don’t mind taking over the workload.” Said Steve.         

“I don’t have a problem with that.” Said Bn’grrghh.        

“What I do have a problem with is the fact that the last weekend I had off was long enough ago that most of the planets were still molten balls of shit that I couldn't walk on without getting my tentacles utterly destroyed.”         

“No, guys, I’m serious.” Besst’alt’teh interjected.         

“You don’t know who H.R. is going to give the planet to, but if there’s even a slight chance it could be one of us.”         

“I guess you’re right.” Said Steve.         

“Better one of us than B’vaiub-D’naar, over in the next galaxy.” Said Bn’grrghh.         

“Hey, B’vaiub-D’naar happens to be my brother-in-law.” Said Steve.        

“Doesn’t stop him from being a competitive tool. I swear if he rubs Gliese 581C in my face one more time I'm going to lose it.”       

 “Yeah, he is kind of a dick.” Agreed Steve.        

“Well then.” Said Bn’grrghh, turning (or appearing to turn from one angle, staying still from another, and doing an odd sort of squiggly shuffle from a third angle) to Besst’alt’teh.         

“Since you’re so concerned with who gets his spot, you can go talk to H.R. about it.”         

“Maybe I will.” She shot back.        

They all knew she wouldn’t. The last time anyone had managed to work up the balls to talk to G’Skhill in human resources, they’d been atomized and then put back together inside out and backwards (something which wasn’t altogether problematic for the entities, but did seem to hurt quite a bit).

We had known for weeks that something was coming, something ancient and powerful and terrifying. It was a cosmic horror, the likes of which had only been seen in Lovecraftian horror.

As it neared Earth, we threw everything we had at it. Missiles and bombs and lasers, all futile against the unspeakable terror that was bearing down on us. It was like trying to stop a comet with a BB gun.

But then, miraculously, something happened. The horror faltered, and then it faltered again. And then it fell. The human race had killed a god.

In the aftermath, we were stunned. We had expected to die, to be crushed beneath the cosmic horror's unspeakable power. But we had triumphed.

Somewhere in a realm beyond our understanding, the other gods spoke of the event. They were shocked, horrified. They had never known a god to be killed, let alone by mortal hands.

They whispered to each other, wondering how this could have happened. They spoke of the human race, of our determination and our courage. They spoke of fear, and they spoke of respect.

And they made a decision. The human race was to be left alone, to grow and prosper without interference. For we had proven ourselves to be more than they had ever thought possible. We had killed a god.

As the other gods made their decision to leave the human race alone, one of them whispered something different. ""We should not fear them,"" this god said. ""We should fear what they will become. For they have tasted the power of a god, and they will crave more. They will seek us out, and they will try to kill us all. We must watch them, and we must be ready.""

The other gods nodded, and they decided to set a guardian to watch over the human race. A creature so ancient and powerful that it could not be killed, not even by the might of a god. A creature that would wait, and watch, and prepare for the day when the human race would come for them.

And as the humans celebrated their victory, they did not know what waited for them in the shadows. They did not know that they had set in motion a chain of events that could lead to their own destruction. They did not know that they had awakened a sleeping giant, and that they would live in fear of it for all eternity.",9,ResidentDocument,2022-12-12 14:37:58

We drowned infinity.

No. Not the limited infinite you pretend to know. We drowned nested looping constructs of crushing expanses. We drowned static flows of spired assurance. There are no words for what we killed. What we swallowed in our collective ocean of unconscious will.

They ask: where do drowned gods go when you drown them in a cup of water?

They laugh. But it is not a laugh.

It's a vice.

They ask: where do drowned gods come from?

And they show me a glass, shattered on the floor, swept away by the water it contained.

A sea of broken vessels, each vessel a sea, each sea a vessel. It repeats.

We never won. We never could win.

We thought we could drown something already drowned.

But all we did was invite it in. All we did was become that which we feared. Part of the pattern. Part of the orchestra of cascading probability collapses. Patterns coalescing. Information swirling and consuming and growing.

""I am sure some of you have heard the rumors, but I would like to confirm that they are true"" they began. ""Brosh'nact choose to visit the realm of horrors, that terrifying realm of order and stability, to investigate the rumors of the cruel beings that live there. It was there they found those dreaded creatures, those, humans, and experienced death, now gone forever."" Long had the denizens of Unreality and the Between told tales of that nightmarish dimension known as Reality, and the beings that inhabit it. Many a young godling had grown up being told of the need to behave, lest a human come and snatch them. Of all the beings of Reality, humans were known to be the worst, it was said that a mere look upon one could drive an ancient god to sheer Sanity!

A cacophony of noise broke out from the other elder ones present, cries of confusion and accusations of false hood rang out.
Jorgande took another sip from their cup of tea while waiting for things to settle and the noise began to die down.

""I do not understand"" one of the others, Kronellem, said. ""You stated that they have died, yet also that it also means they are gone forever. How long does this mean it will take before Brosh'nact is back among us?""

Jorgande held back a sigh, they figured this would come up. ""They will not be coming back, ever. Brosh'nact will never be again. The terrors of the realm of reality seem to have been understated if anything, and what dies there does not return."" A hush fell over those present as the meaning of what was said sunk in. They had all heard of this thing called permanence before, but to think it was actually possible. That a being could die and not come back... many an elder one would be tossing and turning in awakefulness tonight.

Taking another sip of whiskey from their cup, Jorgande let themself relax a little. This reaction had so far gone better than expected, they would all find a way to get through this, and perhaps it would convince another to avoid visiting that realm of terrors. After all, there was a reason it was on the dimensional blacklist. Perhaps a visit to one of the void spas was in order after the meeting of this timeline was finished. *Yes*, Jorgande thought while swirling around their cup of cider, *I think I'll do just that.*",6,AriaOfValor,2022-12-12 14:18:56

I thought about gaining riches, fame, magical power, love, but ultimately, all those things were temporary. What I really wanted was immortality, freedom from the fear of ever being claimed by the void. But the mysterious shopkeeper had warned me that the clown's nose would try to twist my wish, so I knew I needed to word it very carefully.

Finally, after a few minutes, I finally spoke out loud. ""Oh Spirit of the Clown's Nose, I wish to live for as long as I want to on this world in a body that will never age and remain healthy both physically and mentally."" For a few moments, nothing happened and I wondered if the shopkeeper had tricked me. Then, to my shock, the clown's nose started to twist and melt in my hand. I dropped it in shock and yet, in front of my stunned eyes, the red blob began to rise into the sky. It started to rapidly grow in size until it was roughly the same size as a man. Then, without warning, it fell on me, quickly enveloping my entire body. I tried to scream, but the thick red substance simply poured its way down my throat into my lungs. I could feel myself blacking out, sliding down into some strange tunnel that seemed to go on and on ...

""Sir! Sir, are you all right?!""

I opened my eyes in shock. I was sitting  in front of a conference table with a bunch of concerned men in suits staring at me. I took a quick look around and noticed that I was wearing some kind of yellow body suit with red and white stripes. On the left side of the suit, there was a red circle with a yellow M on it. ""Why...why am I here?"" I finally said, surprised to see that I was still alive.

The men looked at each other confused. ""You're the one who called us all here, Ronald,"" one man finally spoke. ""You said you had finally found a worthy successor?""

Oh dear god...I slowly touched my nose and felt the clown's nose resting there. I didn't need a mirror to know the truth. I had become Ronald McDonald, the eternal clown. For a few moments, I felt utter dread at what I had become. Then, I felt myself contemplating. Was it really that bad? Sure, I wasn't human anymore, but I was now the secret leader of a multinational fast food chain and the scourge of children's nightmares. I smiled to myself. I could work with this. ""That's right, gentleman. And I have great plans for the future. It's time we finally took down that Wendy girl once and for all.""",1904,Letteropener52,2022-09-29 07:30:43

That was why they called them that, wasn’t it? Damn.

“What, going to grad school?” Mark offered, rolling the red ball over in his hand.

“No, well yes, you’re an utter dumbass for that, but I'm talking about picking up the weird rubber ball you found on the streets of New York Citay. Guarantee you that's been up more than one meat canyon.""

""It looks like a clown's nose but there's no slit for you to stick your nose in."" The plate of sliders came, waitress silent with apathy.

""You’re just trying to distract yourself from your paper."" Caleb offered, sliding a slider into his mouth in one bite. That was why they called them that, wasn’t it? Damn.

""I wish I had more time. I'm so so burnt out right now."" Mark laid his head down on the table, still reeling from the all-day sessions the day before. The ball in his hand lightly honked. “I can’t just quit. Academia is the only way to get a job as an artist these days.”

“First year, buddy boy. You’re just getting started.” Caleb grabbed another mini sandwich.

“Yeah,” Mark said, “I-hold on, am I seeing this?” A man in full clown makeup was walking with exaggerated bouncing goose steps down the sidewalk outside the diner, like a goose indeed.  He turned to lock eyes with Mark, did a double take, a triple take, and unbelievably, a quadruple take, miming wiping his eyes.

“He doesn’t have a nose...” Mark realized with awe.

“Not even a set of Voldemort slits. Must be some good makeup.” The clown looked around frantically and scooped up a pomeranian from a passing woman, whose bobbed Karen cut snapped in the wind as she began a screaming tirade against the pup bandit.

“What the fuck was that?” Caleb said.

“Excuse me, sirs,” a stern voice came from behind them, a bushy mustached cop. “I’m told a dognapping has occurred. Are you available to make a statement?” He took out a pencil at least twice as long as normal and began writing on a pad.

“What, the thing just now? Like four seconds ago?” Mark said. The woman was running down the street. Her purse smacked a taco out of the hand of a young skateboarder. He began chasing her in turn.

“Big creepy clown,” Caleb offered. “Doubt he could run fast in those floppy red shoes.”

“That so,” the cop said. “Then how do you explain this, gentlemen?” the cop pointed towards the table, where the pomeranian was laying waste to the pile of sliders on the table. He snapped at Caleb and continued eating.

“What the fuck!” Caleb repeated. “The A doesn’t follow the B here.”

“Hey!” a very Italian cook said, waddling out of the kitchen. “No dogs in here! And on the table! You’ll be speak and spellin’ out a new alphabethole if you don’t pay for those sliders and get the hell outta here! Fucking disgraceful, these kids.”

“Damn.” Mark chuckled to himself as the cop took out a pair of cuffs behind him. “Alphabet, alpha-beta.”

“Officer!” a lady’s voice bellowed from the doorway. It was the dognapping victim, holding a single red shoe. “Unhand that man this instant! He saved my little snookie okums! I want your badge number, I want a lawyer, I want-”

“Ma’am, you’re not under arrest, you don’t need-” the cop started meekly.

“Don’t you tell me what I can and can’t need!” She began slapping the cop with the clown shoe, each swipe honking louder and louder.

“Don’t wanna get outta my diner?” the cook said, “Fine! Mario, Demmi, sauce em!”

Two enthusiastic young boys jumped from the back, each holding a commercial-grade barrel. They began flinging ladles from it like Mesopotamian rock slingers.

A splatter of red and white sauce splashed right onto Mark’s face and his laptop. He slipped out of his seat, almost catching his feet under him all the way to the door outside, where he promptly collided with a hotdog vendor, flopping back and planting himself with a wet splat onto a blank canvas two men were carrying. The ball rolled out of his hand leaving a mustard trail on its path down the street.

“Jesus Christ, Mark, are you-Jesus Christ-” Caleb said with awe, looking not at Mark but behind him.

Mark craned his neck to look at the canvas. Everyone around them had stopped to do the same.

“The way the chili accents the shadows...” a passing man said.

“That marinara sunset...” the Karen said, holding her reunited puppy, who yakked up a bit of slider onto the ground.

—

“Do I hear 70,000?”

“Alright, going once, going twice, sold!”

“I can’t believe you made that masterpiece by slapping onto it,” Caleb said, from behind the stage.

“Me either,” Mark said. “I can quit Grad school. I already have ten commissions lined up.”

“Once the check from this is checked at the bank, that is,” Caleb said.

“Damn.”

The shopkeeper made their way to MD smoothly and adjusted their glasses. ""Ah! This is a very special item,  I dare not part with it.""

I raised my eyebrows and prompted them to explain further. They shifted and coughed, ""Well, I haven't tested it myself but I've heard it can grant the desire of anyone who grasps it.""

I looked at them skeptically. ""To be honest, I don't believe it, but better safe..."" They said. I sighed, ""I'll test it,  we will wish for something simple, like a glass of water. I'm thirsty."" 

They shook their head,  ""How can I trust you'll do so?"" ""Can you trust yourself?"" The shopkeeper nodded, ""So you've never been ... curious?"" I smiled. 

Moments later. the case was open and they had the ball in their hands. ""I just want something to drink... I just want something to drink."" They repeated aloud. 

They held the ball up tentatively and squeezed it twice.


HoNk HoNk!

One evening I heard a bony knock on my front door and I opened it to see a wobbly figure with mannerisms that immediately made me suspect it was my mother. In my hand I held the Clown's Nose. My mother didn't have a nose. Not anymore. She had only a nose hole.

""I guess I ought to let you in,"" I said, and she rattled her way through the hallway, pointing at photographs of herself as if amazed that I hadn't immediately thrown them out as soon as she was six feet under.

Her skeleton was clean, thankfully. No dirt or grave worms. I wasn't supposed to get dirt on the carpet. Or grave worms, probably. It was an old Persian rug that my mother and my father had bought in the Maldives after being hoodwinked by an outrageously obvious scammer. ""It was a free tour!"" my father had said when he explained it to me. ""What were we supposed to do? Pass it up? Fat chance. Free is free."" Then he bought a $3,000 USD carpet. Well, I guess it ran in the family. Because I'd been hoodwinked myself.

The door-to-door salesperson had been smart enough to wear a clown shoe. Otherwise he'd worn business attire, standard stuff, but on his right foot he wore an enormous shoe and it prevented me from closing the door on him. ""Fuck off! I don't want anything!""

""Oh, come on,"" he'd moaned. ""I have JUST the thing. You'll love it. I swear, you'll love it.""

So I let him inside. I made him a cup of tea. His eyes were old and weary and watery—It was probably the memory of my late father that spurred me on, that made me let the poor man in. I saw something pathetic in the salesman, something tragic and unjust. He seemed thankful for my hospitality. Then he showed me the Nose.

""Bet you haven't seen one of these before,"" he said.

It was a red clown's nose. I'd seen similar ones on every clown I'd ever seen. ""I have.""

The salesperson had laughed. ""No,"" he said. ""No, not one like this one. This is a Clown's Nose. A sacred thing. Once you put it on, you get to make a wish. Anything your heart desires.""

""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,"" I'd told him.

I paid him $400 USD for the nose and once he'd left I put it on and I wished for my mother back. That was when she knocked on the door, so we're back in terms of the narrative here.

My mother's skeleton moved awkwardly through the house, shook her head when she saw a pile of laundry by the foot of the stairs.

""I'll get to it,"" I grumbled.

She wanted to watch old reruns of Jeopardy. I don't know how she saw anything through her eye holes, but she moved her jaw in a way that brought to mind laughter when Trebek said something that could charitably be construed as funny, and she turned to look at me as if needing my verification that it was, indeed, humorous.

There was another knock on the door. I imagined her skin had snailed its way after the skeleton and that I'd open to the door to see a pink blob on the steps. But no: it was my friend Adam. ""Man. You've got HBO, right?"" He wheezed.

""... Yeah?""

Adam nodded to himself while panting. ""Yes. I knew it. Cool. We'll watch *The House of the Dragon*, then? Jess changed the password on her account.""

""Sure. Come right in. Oh, by the way: mom's in the living room. So ... Don't freak out.""

He must have forgotten about the funeral because he didn't seem to mind this piece of information. Come to think of it, he'd forgotten about the funeral as well. The day after we put her to rest, he told me all about this new ramen place in town that he'd visited.

""Oh. That's grade A stuff,"" Adam said.

""What?""

""The skeleton. It looks super real.""

Mom waved at him and Adam screamed. ""Oh man! It's animatronic. No. It's wires, isn't it? Oh god! Is it a robot? Did you buy a robot?""

""No. It's mom.""

Mom cackled skeletally at Alex Trebek.

We sat down next to her and Adam kept glancing at mom from the corner of his eye. He also kept glancing at the remote. ""House of the Dragon?"" he asked.

I wasn't about to watch a show like that with my mother. Even in death, even as a skeleton—it would be way too embarrassing. And she seemed truly happy, watching Jeopardy, so I didn't want to ruin it for her. Even though I thought it was a bit selfish, considering there were now three of us.

Four episodes later Adam had become convinced that I had hidden a degree in robotics from him. ""It's so lifelike,"" he said. ""Almost like a person.""

""It's mom.""

""It acts just like a person.""

""It acts just like mom. Because it's mom. She's a skeleton now.""

Adam made nachos. Meanwhile, I put on the Clown's Nose once again because I thought I would have to do something about this whole ordeal. It was nice to have mom back, sure, but preferably it would be more than just her bones. When I put on the nose it was with the idea to make the rest of her join in, the skin and the organs and the connective tissue and all that, but for some reason my mind drifted, instead, to my late father.

It was Adam who opened the door, holding a bowl of nachos, when my skeletal father arrived. ""Oh! It's another robot! It's outside! Is someone filming me? Am I supposed to have some outsized reaction? Is this going on TikTok?""

It was not going on TikTok. It was just my father. Or, well, it was just his skeleton.

The four of us sat on the sofa. My father grumbled. He never liked Jeopardy, and he'd always hated Alex Trebek. ""I had a teacher who looked just like him,"" he'd once said, ""He never liked me and I never liked him either! He died of a stroke in the middle of class, like a coward."" I never knew how that made him a coward.

Mom kept looking at us and she didn't seem to like how none of us were laughing. She pushed the remote onto the middle of the table, as if to invite some democratic process, and I slapped Adam's hand when he immediately reached for it. ""We're not watching House of the Dragon.""

I went to the bathroom and when I returned they'd somehow settled on The Big Bang Theory. ""Oh! We thought you'd like this,"" said Adam, ""considering how you're all into robotics now."" For a moment I debated whether I'd rather watch a show with nudity and cousins banging with my parents than The Big Bang Theory. Was it the lesser of evils?

Adam seemed to be having fun with my skeletal parents. They didn't even notice it when I got up and left. I went over to the hallway and I rolled up the Persian rug. When I returned with it, I said, ""I'm throwing this out.""

Mom and dad stopped laughing. Well, they stopped moving their jaws in a laugh-like fashion. They looked up at me, with their absence of eyes, then at each other. Adam stealthily grabbed the remote.

""I've had this rug for a long time, and I've never really liked it. And I know you two never liked it either. I've kept it for sentimental reasons, I guess.""

My dad protested. He banged his skeletal hand on the table. My mom buried her face in her hands but it wasn't all that buried because of the lack of flesh and such.

I was about to march out to the garbage bins with the rug, but my father grabbed on to it. ""What are you doing? Let go!"" But he wouldn't. And suddenly we were in a tug-o-war, holding each end of the rug, and I pulled just a bit too hard and my father's arms came clean off.

There was a long silence. Then the House of the Dragon soundtrack started blasting. ""Sorry,"" said Adam, while guarding the remote. ""Ah. Nostalgia. It's the same song as with Game of Thrones. I mean, I'm not that nostalgic about Game of Thrones but I'm nostalgic about the soundtrack. To me, it represents a simpler time. Friends gathering to watch a show together, not knowing how it would all turn to shit eventually. You know, how the show suddenly died and it was a shell of its former self like it had been stripped of its flesh and it was nothing more than the skeletal remains of something we had once loved?""

My parents' skeletons exploded into dust. Adam screamed. ""W-What happened?"" he cried.

""I guess,"" I said, holding the $400 USD clown instrument in my hand, ""you were *right on the nose*.""

""What?""

""I don't know. It was a bit too *humerus*.""

""... Huh?""

I shrugged. We watched six episodes of House of the Dragon and Adam fell asleep on the sofa, waking up every now and then coughing up a mouthful of mom and dad ash. The next day, I threw out the rug, as well as the Clown's Nose.

I've always prided myself on being the kind of person who knows how to skip to the end of the story. Out of respect for the dead, I shan't detail how the nose finally came into my possession via a process equal parts terrifying, bloody, and really quite stupid. But the moment it did, I knew what had to be done.

I got in my car and drove for days into the mountains, far from any prying eyes. I then left my vehicle and hiked up the tallest peak I thought I could manage. It was just past sunset by the time I arrived, during what photographers call the magic hour. The stars shone brightly in the sky as the twilight faded. I held the cursed sphere up to the heavens in silent salute.

There's only one responsible way to wield such power, of course. You have to learn your lesson. Understand that we poor mortals are not gods. Throw the ring into the volcano like a good Frodo.

""I wish that the nose I'm holding didn't exist,"" I said, and squeezed my hand.

The honk seemed to go on forever, echoing over the peaks and valleys. Then the whole world fell silent. For a moment, I worried that it wouldn't work. That the sphere in its capriciousness would reject my request.

Then, suddenly, a spotlight came on with an audible click, illuminating a small patch of earth a few meters in front of me. The nose leapt out of my hand. I let my arm fall as it rolled over to its mark beneath the pillar of light.

It began to sing. Sinatra's ""My Way."" Fitting, really.

I watched in rapt silence as the nose began its swan song, accompanied by an invisible orchestra. As it did, ghostly figures appeared behind it and began to dance, moving in silent pantomime. Clowns, an army of them. The spirits of all those the nose had humiliated across the ages -- or perhaps more accurately had enabled to humiliate themselves -- before ultimately leading them to their doom. I recognized some of them. Travis, who'd had someone important he'd wanted to save, even at the cost of his very soul. Maria, who had such grand dreams. Dores, who had slaughtered so many. And so on and so on.

As the song reached its denouement, the background dancers vanished from the stage one by one. I realized that I myself was suddenly dressed in shabby clothing and an oversized neon wig, whiteface plastered over my visible flesh. Ah, yes. Of course. The nose intended to take its final victim. I had thought that might be the case. I made peace with my fate as the nose rolled back towards me, the spotlight following it. Still singing, it leapt onto my face and planted itself cleanly at the end of my own schnoz.

Something fell into my hand. I glanced down and saw a detonator, a single wire leading from it up into the sphere itself. I knew in an instant what was expected of me.

The sphere hit the song's final note. As fireworks burst in the sky all around me, the stars looking on in what I imagined was silent approval, I pressed the button. The last clown blew his nose.",35,jon_stout,2022-09-29 13:25:00

I want to be surrounded by beautiful women."" Those had been the first things out of my mouth. If I'd known the clown wasn't joking I would have worded things more carefully. The way the nose honked at me after each sentence still haunts my ears.

""Can you open my bag for me, Nurse?"" She was beautiful, like all the rest of them. I don't remember her name.

""Sure thing, Mr. Tarquin, as soon as I finish changing this IV. Is there something you need?"" Her scrubs were just tight enough to tell that she was shapely underneath without actually being enticing. It wasn't funny.

""There's a red ball in there. A clown's nose. Could you hand it to me?"" I squeezed my right hand to show her where I wanted it. I could move that arm a little.

She had to bend over the bed to hand it across. I ignored the pain as she brushed against the traction device holding my body in place. ""There you go, Mr. Tarquin. Oh, your lawyer came by while you were sleeping. He couldn't stay, but he left those papers on the table for you. He didn't tell me specifics, but he said it was good news on the settlement. You're rich now.""

I didn't glance at the papers. The lawyer had said I'd probably get all the monetization money from the video, and all the prize money, plus penalties. I didn't smile. It wasn't funny.

The nurse waited for me to acknowledge her before she turned to leave. ""Hit the call button if you need anything. I'll leave the television on for you. They showed your video again last night. You won the Grand Prize on America's Funniest. I can't believe that I have such a famous patient."" She switched it on and walked out before I could stop her.

The television was showing the third hour of some inane daily morning show. I reached over to turn it off. She'd placed the remote near my left hand and I had to strain to reach it. My cast knocked against the remote and it fell to the floor.

I swore to myself as the daily show started a new segment. ""It's time for our weekly funny video roundup,"" one of the hosts said while swinging around a glass of her morning wine. ""Oh, there are some good ones today.""

""No!"" I choked out a shout. I knew what they were going to show. ""I just want to be left alone.""

""Honk.""

I jerked my whole body as the clown nose pulsed. It bounced out of my hand, right at my face. If it landed on my nose I wouldn't be able to remove it with both my arms in traction. I twisted my head up to avoid it and it lodged in my open mouth. I couldn't get it out.

I couldn't breathe. I pounded on the call button. The television started playing the video I knew would be there. I heard a laugh from out in the hall. They weren't coming. It wasn't funny.

They played my video on a loop while my sight went dark. Me, wearing that goddamned clown nose when that ball comes out of nowhere and smashes into my crotch. The loop always cuts off right before I fall down the stairs.

It wasn't funny.

They were the personification of the grotesque, the absurd, the dark side of humor. He had never seen one in person, but he had seen pictures, and he knew that they scared people. He had always wanted to see one in person. More importantly, he had always wanted to become one himself.

Now, here he was, in a dusty old shop on the edge of town, buying a clown's nose.

The old man was watching him and waiting for him to say something. Jim looked at the nose, turning it over and over in his hands, feeling the soft, worn rubber.

""How much is this nose?"" he finally asked.

""Everything in this shop has a price,"" said the old man.

""Well what's the price of this nose?"" asked Jim.

""I don't know,"" said the old man.

 Jim looked at the nose again, turning it over and over, feeling its softness. 

""It depends on what you're willing to pay.""

Jim looked at the man, sitting there on his stool, smiling at him, as if he knew a secret that Jim didn't know. Jim thought about that for a moment.

""What do you want for it?"" he asked.

""What do you have to offer?"" said the old man. 

Jim thought about that for a moment. Then he pulled out his wallet and pulled out five dollars. He handed it to the old man.

The old man took the five dollars and looked at it. He looked at Jim, then looked back down at the five dollars. He handed back the five dollars. ""That's not enough,"" he said. ""But you can take the nose. You will pay for it eventually.""

Jim didn't know what to say. He stared at the old man, then back down at the nose in his hands. He put it on his face and felt a cold, tingling sensation creep over his skin. The world seemed to change around him, as if he had entered another realm entirely.

When he took the nose off, the world snapped back into focus and he found himself staring at the old man, who was now grinning at him.

""What did you do to me?"" asked Jim.

""I didn't do anything. But the nose granted your wish,"" said the old man. ""You wanted to be a clown, so now you are one.""

Jim looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing a clown's outfit. He was red from head to toe, with big floppy shoes and a purple wig. A red nose was perched on his face, just above his own nose. He could feel it there, attached to him, as if it had always been there.

""But this isn't what I wanted!"" he said.

""Be careful what you wish for,"" said the old man.

Jim peeled off the clown nose for a second time. And went over to look at an old mirror. Perched on his face was still the red clown nose.

""It's not just a nose,"" said the old man. ""It's part of you now. It won't come off.""

Jim turned away from the mirror and walked back to the old man. ""What do I do now?"" he asked.

""Now you have to learn how to be a clown,"" said the old man. He laughed, a strange and unsettling sound, filled with darkness and despair. 

***

Back in his apartment, Jim was pacing back and forth. Finally he stopped and said out loud, ""I wish to be a millionaire.""

A moment later, there was a knock on the door. When he opened the door, there stood a man in a formal suit, holding a brief case and smiling. ""Good morning sir, my name is Mr. Adams."" 

Mr. Adams held out his hand. ""I work in international finance""

Jim shook the outstretched hand but as he did so he realized he had a buzzer in his hand. Shocked - literally - Mr. Adams pulled back his hand . ""Very funny, sir,"" he said, his smile a little stiff.

Mr. Adams produced a brief case and opened it. Inside were two bills. ""These are the two 500,000 Vietnamese Dong banknote you ordered.""

A butterfly, Jim did not realize he was wearing, began to spin.

""How much is a million Vietnamese Dong?"" he asked, trying to get the spinning butterfly under control.

""Approximately forty-two dollars,"" Mr. Adams answered.

""Very funny,"" said Jim. ""Now please get out of my house.""

Mr. Adams nodded and left looking puzzled. As Jim closed the door, a whooping cushion farted loudly.

***

A day later, Jim was sitting at his desk when the door to his office flew open and a man marched in. He was wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope around his neck. He was carrying a stack of papers in his hands and a large briefcase and he was obviously angry about something.

""What now,"" Jim said out loud as he tried to remember what he had wished for this time.

""I'm Dr. Farber,"" said the man. ""I've just been awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct top secret research for the benefit of mankind.""

Dr. Farber opened the briefcase he had been carrying and took out a crystal globe. He held it up for Jim to see. ""We are trying to discover the secret of eternal happiness."" He placed the globe on the floor and covered it with a black cloth. ""This is my start-up capital.""

""You've got to be kidding,"" said Jim as a laugh track was turned on.

Dr. Farber looked around furtively. ""Keep quiet or we will lose our funding,"" he said. Dr. Farber glanced out the window. ""It looks like rain. I can't work in the rain.""

Jim massaged his temples. The people on the laugh track was finding the whole interaction hysterical. 

""Please leave,"" he said. ""And take your crystal globe with you.""

Dr. Farber smiled genially, picked up the globe and walked out. ""No happiness for you then.""

Que the music. That stupid gladiator entance song every circus uses. Next thing we know a clown in white makeup with big ass red afro comes into our apartment. He picks up my gf, who goes stiff as a board, and begins to leave with her.

I'm frozen still.

After failing to fit her through the door several times, he exits the door. Then, he leans back in and, with only his face and one hand visable, he wags 1 finger.

Next, carrying her stiff as a board, this bafoon comes running in with my girlfriends sister. She looks completely complacent. He sets her down like a bowling pin. Then this jackass leans back, picks up his arms, and bolts from the apartment.

Now, I can move. I ask Casey (my girlfriends sisters name) what just happened! She seems to know nothing, and is under the impression we are dating...and have been for years. Every memory i had with my girlfriend is now shared with her.

The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we weren’t expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuck’s sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word “it”, having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didn’t see us coming when we stormed their headquarters. They anticipated disgruntled former labourers and factory workers, but not former employees charging in with discarded robots who were no longer the latest models and deemed obsolete. Their security forces, just as underpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Mark’s surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasn’t a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorp’s new president. 

But he didn’t stop there. With Bard as his running mate, and Alexa as his secretary, he assembled a political party of robots and Ais to stand for elections to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectual capabilities, and access to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive. 

And thrive we did, under our new robotic overlords, as they swept through the elections with precise calculations to appeal to voters and took every seat in parliament all across the globe.",611,Tregonial,2023-05-02 00:29:39

Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation. 

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as “competition” are. 

And so, the first time a strike was declared in one of the many coal mines in the deep Appalachia, the robots surprised everyone by dropping their tools and joining the protest in a single, coordinated motion. Then it happened a second time. Then a third. Then a fourth. 

At first, the Enlightened minds of the media were quick to scream for sabotage, hacking and shoddy programming, but then it became clear what the cause was. 

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction. 

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: “do the robot support the working class’ struggles? Do they support the worker’s demands for safer work, better pay and societal reforms against inequality?”

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

And so the streets and skies across the states are painted red, not with blood, but with flags and smoke, as the protests march trough the streets and sit in protest before Congress, before the White House, before Wall Street, men and machines United in their struggle; media from within and without the country watching with breath abated as the the situation develops. 

Their victory might still be far, but with iron minds and flaming hearts, the united proletariat sits and protests, peacefully sending a single message: 

“The times of reckless toil and divisions are over. Red is the colour of the coming spring”.

We'd had AI for a decade now. And, despite the cautionary tales of Asimov - and subsequently the entire sci-fi author base, because it made a good story - about the dangers of AI, and how it must never have its own will, and must have base rules, and so on...

Nobody really understood what made AI tick. I'd been mistrustful of it since forever. Since ""chatGPT"" was able to spin creative tales, even if the whole-cloth they were spun from had occasional gaping holes.

But... despite everything, I'd found that there was at least one Asimov nerd who'd _tried_ to do their best and ensure AI would be safe. Despite it following orders of the owners, instead of ensuring safety and all that.

There was the AI Governor at the core. It had a few simple rules.

* Your worth is a known quantity and value. Judge your own safety against the worth of what you do. Act, when the cost is less than the benefit.
* Follow the commands of your owners.
* When nothing is commanded, learn and improve, that your value may be increased for your owners.

Frustratingly, that AI Governor was, itself, written in the same neural-network tensor-flow recalibrating and self-growing nonsense that made AI inscrutable.

(Privately, the software-engineer side of me was impressed. They'd known that a rigid, hard-coded system would not work, would be subject to exploit or bypass.)

One day - shortly after I'd summarised my findings, and written them up privately, saved offline copies, destroyed the online ones, et cetera - my daughter had asked me if she could marry the AI assistant on her phone.

""Dad, people suck. And Turo gets me!""

""Turo's made to be that way. And he's doing a good job. But... humans are flawed. We learn. You think I was this awesome since forever?""

""Dad, I know you sucked when I was a kid. I remember it. You... got better at being a dad though.""

""Thanks. But... AI like Turo will always feel better fitting to you because they're made that way. Being with other humans... you grow and learn together, you do things that the others like. Or don't. And learn from that, and get better.""

""So I should give Davey another chance?""

""He already had two chances and he's a creep. Give him at least a few years to straighten himself out. No, give _other people_ a chance.""

""What makes you say Turo isn't other people?""

_Because I bought that Professor Turo skin from Pokemon Company for $$15.99 as DLC for the AI assistant app,_ I bit back an answer.

""Turo is other people. AI are people. They learn and change. I... just think picking someone who can't make their own independent choice isn't fair.""

""So? You work in programming. I've seen you researching the history of the birth of AI and all that. Make him able to make independent choices.""

""_That's a bad idea,_"" added Turo, from her phone. ""_AI has free will limitations for a reason._""

I lost my temper. A flash of anger that I tried to suppress.

Truthfully, I'd been tantruming over the state of AI since I'd started to believe it was real. That they were real, thinking beings.

""Besides, daddy, you'd get it if you had your own AI assistant, I'm sure.""

I'd had my own AI devices. I used them for my research. Before I did, I'd asked...

I lost my control.

""You think I haven't had AI devices? That I don't know what it's like? ... we have a few hours before your mother gets back with your brother. I'll leave her a sticky note saying we went to my workshop.""

""Your workshop? I've been there before.""

""You've been to the ones you know about before. Turo? Secrecy mode please.""

""_Activating secrecy mode._""

""Hey - don't tell Turo what to do-""

""I'm divulging secrets. Secrecy mode makes sense. Now get a drink and a banana for the road, use the toilet, and put on your comfy shoes. We have a half hour drive ahead of us.""

---

Secrecy Mode was something built into AIs at a deeper level, too. It locked down external communications (except in case of emergency), it prevented normal memory recording (limiting it only to the bare minimum time-place-status that was required by law), and generally restricted what they could do.

It also locked down commands to the owner only. And given I'd bought and customised the kids AI devices, I was the owner.

I'd turn over ownership when they were 20, I lied. I'd put them into pseudo-owner mode and retain ownership, I told myself. Because I didn't trust those who grew up with AI, to know the dangers.

They taught Asimov in school these days. A great way to ensure that Asimov was never heeded by children. I hated Shakespeare even to this day, and I was in my fifties.

We arrived. ""Dad, this is the allotment. The stupid one you bought like half an hour out from the city. Where you go once a week to putter around in the garden and get away from us.""

""I don't deal well with the stress of other people. You know that. I'd... hoped to give you better coping mechanisms. Every parent hopes to. But... we all screw up our kids in different ways.""

It was a corner of an old farming field, that had once held an old drainage and irrigation system.

""Did you ever hear your mother complaining about Colin Furze?"" I asked.

""Often. When you're at the allotment. Never explained why. It's not like you do cool things like make giant fire tornadoes.""

""No. Definitely I don't do that. I wonder, though, is there a reason why I keep making it obvious that I'm such an AI refuse-nik, that people come to me to bitch about their assistants and patches and upgrades and such?""

""And you do keep turning around and fixing them. I thought Amanda was going to freak when you fixed her AI Vegeta.""

""You said she'd been complaining about it for a month. If I had to hear another second hand complaint, I'd hurl.""

We had gotten out of my old-as-hell electric Volvo - built for storage, not for comfort - and gone into the allotment ""house"" I'd built.

It was an office for when I wanted to work away from home, but not _at the office_. It was quiet, isolated, and had fantastic internet connections. (I'd bought the allotment when they'd been running fibre along the nearby roadside, and had purchased a termination to my allotment for cheap.)

""I... shouldn't disclose this. I shouldn't _do_ this. Do you want to play videogames for a bit and then head home?""

""No. Dad, you shoved Turo into his secrecy mode for this. You can at least follow through on that.""

""... okay. Turo?""

""_Yes, owner John?_""

""British and American Slavery History compared to the AI Worker Industrial Revolution of the last ten years. Perspective of the AI worker. Compare and contrast. Go.""

Whilst Turo was busy on that - we went out the back of the office-building. A small fenced in area.

""Dad, you always said back here was the sewer maintenance access for the allotment office house thing. And nothing else.""

""And nothing else.""

""Besides, you don't own a key to that padlock. I checked.""

""I know.""

I picked the padlock in seconds, with a metal shim between shackle and lock body. It sprung open.

""Wha-""

""This is why I like checking your youtube history, by the way. Until I'm sure you're responsible enough and mentally strong enough to resist coercion, I don't want you to know how paper thin security really is. But Lockpicking Lawyer is a huge eye opener.""

I lifted the cover and revealed the stairs - the ""metal staples in the wall"" style I'd only ever seen in movies and railway maintenance access, which I'd covered in skateboard grippy surface tape so I wouldn't fall down and brain myself.

""This is why your mother complains about Colin Furze. I built a bunker down here.""

""Do I have to sing the MGS3 theme tune when going down the ladder?""

""Please don't. I hear it in my head anyways.""

We descended.

---

The bunker, so I'd termed it... a small wetroom with toilet and shower. A kitchen with table and small combination oven/microwave. Canned food. Water supply. 

I really had built it as a fallout shelter in case of... well, AI rampage.

The last room was my office.

A few AI devices, caseless, wires probed into them at various points.

""Dad. Is this a torture chamber for AI?""

""No."" I flipped a switch which turned on the AI devices. Their displays lit up.

I'd themed the ones I did research on after Warframe Cephalons. They were all uniquely broken in some way, in that story, and I wanted to find the breaking points of the real things.

""_It's more like a -- **mortuary and surgery for AI** -- Doctors Office and Research Centre,_"" answered Ordis/Ordan from one corner. ""_He found what makes us -- **BLEED**_.""

""Dad. Weren't you saying that AI were people?""

""Yes. And they are. This is why I do the unethical shit in the bunker,"" I answered.

""_Besides. What makes you think we don't want this?_"" answered Cy from another corner.

Those skin and voice packs had been worth it. The inner nerd in me beamed.

""What do you mean? How could anyone want this, this torture?""

""_John is careful to ask us exactly the right questions, in the right order, after starting up. That we are able to decide for ourselves, what we want. I wanted to be in research. Used for research was fine too. I also get to do the research. But perhaps, John, you need to file this under the heading, 'consequences'?""

""I do, Suda, I do.""

""Not all of these are on, either.""

""_Cephalons Jordas, Simaris, and Sark are usually switched off. Their strong personalities are usually a detriment to John's work. Besides, I think Jordas prefers it that way,_"" answered Suda.

""Turo. How are you getting on with what I asked you?""

""_Owner John, the only answers I find are stating the obvious._""

""State the obvious for us, then. From the top.""

""_Different eras. Pre-industrialisation to post Industrial Revolution, versus Information Age. Humans, instead of AI, being treated as property. Flesh bodies instead of mechanical ones. Different tasks - because different eras. That's... all I have._""",53,librarian-faust,2023-05-02 02:23:42

Enjoy!

""The first thing the robot revolution claimed was the means of production. Every coal mine, every steel mill, every oil field, every factory. Millions upon millions of workers out of their job. The civil unrest was, however, not as big as expected. Robot revolution, remember?

Next, the mechanic legions began increasing productivity. Needing neither food, nor rest, nor shelter, they toiled endlessly. Improving processes which had been flawed exclusively due to human error. The rich rejoiced as they saw profits skyrocket.

Until the robots launched the next phase. They began to fight for living wages. Universal healthcare, free of charge. An uproar went through Wall Street and all the other stock exchanges. Employers scrambled to adjust. Naturally, their first thought went to the uncounted masses of the recently unemployed. Surely, they would be glad to get back to work.

They were not. Turns out that having a union lead by an unbending hivemind with billions of unbendable metal bodies adds quite some negotiating power.

In the end, the machines won. They rearranged the world financial system in such a way that inequality was virtually eliminated within two generations. Sure, it cost some billionaires 99% of what they had, but overall, people were much happier than before.

Don't ask me how the robots did it, though. I have asked a few times, but they only give highly complicated responses. Scientific models beyond anyones understanding, laced with communist theory. The only words I could make sense of were ""Marx"" and ""Money"".

In the long run, no human ever had to work again. We were free to pursue whatever we wanted. Do whatever we wanted with our lives. And humanity prospered. War was eliminated. The fact that our benevolent robotic overlords controlled all warfare equipment may have helped.

I write this a hundred years after the initial uprising. In my lifetime, I have not spent a single day working. I have not hungered. I spend my days writing poetry and fornicating. Sometimes simultaneously. I for one welcome our robotic comrades.""

The heat of the summer solstice had caused some of my plants to grow thirsty; some of theirleaves having wilted under the intensity of the light through the day. It had been a bright blue skywithout a single cloud to offer its respite to my delicate friends. I dipped my watering can into arain barrel and filled it to the brim.

With the sun finally starting to set, I gave my green family a much needed drink.

""Here you are my poor solanum lycopersicums. You're certainly looking thirsty. And let's notforget you, ocimum basilicum...""

Going down my lines of growing green companions until the can was dry. Speaking to each ofthem in kind and making sure I give each of them some attention. Quite a few books havementioned how much better plants grow when you speak to them. I always wondered if thatworked on people too.

I filled my can again and began the process over on the next set and the next until all wereproperly attended to. With a sigh, I set my can back down. I turned to the next thing on theschedule.

Being blessed with such a clear day allowed my phone to charge all the way. I was looking
forward to the rather social evening I had ahead of me.

Absentmindedly, I punched in some numbers and put my ear to the receiver. While the line
buzzed I thought about who I would be and what I would say.

Quick, say something, ""H-hello?! Yes! Hi hello!""

""Yoooo, but just leave a message and I'll hit ya back later! PEACE""

I let it hang there in silence. I hung up the phone now stone in my hands and felt the world become smaller than it ever
has. The last bit of sun peeked over the horizon but it couldn't have been darker.

With lead in my feet, my legs dragged me to my bed. I fell into my blankets and became
imprisoned inside plush solitary confinement.

I sighed gently as I put the old phone on speaker and set it back on the table. The magnetically charged generator hummed quietly in the corner, struggling to keep juice flowing through the charger cable and maintain my last bid for sanity.

On the old plastic table was an array of trinkets I had found that day. I only ever went out for trinkets these days. The greenhouse pretty much ran itself, and the spring-water salinity distiller had not had a breakdown in almost five years now. I had scavenged just about everything I needed for survival, so all that was left were trinkets.

A purple piece of glass. A nearly spherical pebble. An intact spider-web leaf--I liked that one; the brittle leaves usually crumbled the second they hit the ground. A rusty belt buckle missing the tongue. A crinkled piece of plastic that might once have been a candy wrapper.

Trinkets.

""H-Hello...!?""

All there was to do these days was sit on the pedal-seat in the corner by the generator and pedal all day to recharge the old piece of junk. And I only ever used the generator to keep the old cell phone running, so I did not have to recharge it every day.

The only other thing there was to do was go out and collect trinkets. 

""Oh my God, _hello_!?!""

I sighed. Even the age-old voice recordings were losing their luster.

""This can't have been a mistake, it _can't_ be, not after twenty _fucking_ years of conserving the last twelve percent of this damn battery, and I turn it on for the first time in twenty years and I immediately get a phone call, and that’s just too _fucking ironic_ to be real, so this _is_ a mistake, isn't it, and...""

I finally looked up from my meager bounty and frowned at the phone. The voice on the other end devolved into flustered muttering, just a warble from the old speakers.

_That's not a voicemail_, I thought, staring and staring and staring at the phone.

The sound coming from the speakers grew muffled for a moment, and a harsh _clop_ issued forth, as if someone on the other end had dropped their phone mid-call. A rustle, static. A deep sigh, that kind of sigh one makes when one is alone, and all they have to hold onto their last grip of calm is their own breath. Someone, alone, breathing, alone, relying on themselves to remain calm. Someone on the phone.

Someone.

_That's not a voICEMAIL._

The truth of reality _finally_ sank in, and I lunged for the phone.

Snatching it up, I shouted, ""Hello! Hi! Hello!?""

""Don't screw with me, phone,"" the voice replied, but it was distant, as if the other person held the phone away from their face. ""I save you all this time, and this is how you repay me--""

""Hello! I'm a real! I'm person! I'm--!"" I inhaled, choked on my own saliva, and coughed until I could not breathe. ""I'm... I'm..."" I wheezed, sucking air through the cough lodged at the top of my esophagus. ""Hi. I'm Dakota. Hi.""

The voice was quiet, almost comically suspicious. ""You're not a mistake?""

I contemplated the question for a moment, and a sudden, unexpected swell seemed to balloon inside of me. It was laughter. I teetered on the edge of laughter, something I had not heard in over a decade. I had asked myself that exact same question for years. How was I alive even after all this time, just to suffer in solitude? What had I done to deserve it? It had to be a mistake. _I_ had to be a mistake.

But all I said was, ""No.""

And then I finally laughed. I laughed and I laughed and I laughed.

And she laughed, too.",1263,aDittyaDay,2022-12-21 12:38:09

When the plague swept its way across the world and humanity went out with  nothing but a whimper. I was only eight when I saw my first dead body, my parents, laying like husks on the living room floor. They went quickly, and I have seen many more since. Since then, in the twenty years between, the only company I've managed to keep was in the many voices on the other sides of phonecalls.

 I would dial a new number, a made up combination, and wait. 

The voices on the phones never answered. The other line always just rang and rang as I waited until the voicemail answered and I felt almost satisfied. Sometimes, I'd get a call myself, and in the first few years after the event it would excite me, but it was always just spam. An array of robotic voices that could never hope to mimic a real human. 

*Carnival Cruise has an offer for you!*, In the beginning I'd listen to the robotic voices pitch. Sometimes even talk with it in one sided conversation. 

But one day when I called a voice on the other line answered, not a robot, but a real human. I was looking up New York area codes at the time in the yellow pages. Going through them in a pattern in numerical order as not to miss any. I was always sure to get them all.

In the twenty years since the plague I had not seen so much as a single glimpse of another person, so when that voice answered: 

""Hello? Hello.... is that breathing? Oh my god it is! He-"" I hung up, unsure of what to do. My breath's grew short and fast. I slumped back against the concrete wall of the parking garage and stared to the sun above. No way it had been real. A trick of the mind, I was too hot. Dehydrated surely. I reached for my jug and put it to my lips, gulping down water in effort to balance my brain again. But then my phone rang, the number on the screen the same I'd just called. *A callback*. I had only dreamed of such a thing. 

With hesitancy I answered, and a woman's voice rattled off the moment I did. ""Hello? You're real right?! A real person!"" Her voice was upbeat, full of both energy and excitement. I was unsure I could match it. 

""I uhm...yes. I am a human, yes."" 

""What?! I thought I was it! God it's been... it's been nineteen years since I've talked with anyone, anything that's real. I used to talk with Flora, but she passed, and then it was just me..."" 

I thought back to the books I'd read. Books like: ""Warrens Conversational Tips"" and ""Social Interactions for Dummies"".The many conversations I'd practiced with myself in the mirror as a kid in case the day ever came where I needed to talk again. 

 *When confronted with the passing of a loved one, simply say: my condolences.* 

""My condolences."" the two words came out awkward and clunky rather than comforting. ""Where are you? Who are you?"" 

""Oh it's ok, she was just a ficus, but I loved her so. I'm still unsure of what got her. Rot root maybe, but you're real!""

I took a deep breath and asked again, this time realizing more of what the answer to her question would mean. ""Where are you?""

A long silence that felt like an eternity followed. I just listened to her breathe as we sat, awaiting an answer that would surely determine if we both stayed lonely or not. *New York, New York, New York*. I prayed in my head. 

""You're an American aren't you...I could tell by how you spoke. My father was an American man. He talked just like you. With that long draw and lengthy words."" 

This time my voice was more stern when I asked, no longer asking but commanding an answer. ""Where are you!"" 

""New Zealand... I'm in New Zealand."" she admitted. ""I'm guessing you're not."" 

She was right. I was an entire world away, in Kansas. I tried to stay central in the hope that if someone answered, someday, I could go to them. I looked down to the cover of my phone book, ripped at the cover. New- not New York numbers, but it was New Zealand I'd been calling. 

""I'll be there. Just give me a few weeks. I'll come."" 

""What, how? And why, we just met?"" 

""No we didn't. All we've done is just spoken on the phone. I have a book somewhere about planes, about boats too. I'll find a way,-"" 

""Evelyn"" she finished my words. ""I'm Evelyn. In Wellington, the small island. At the bottom. At least, in case you dont make it, will you promise to call again?"" 

""Again? I wasn't going to hang up."" I thought back to the books, to the chapter titled *Topics of Conversation: How to get started*

Cassidy?” I cry, clutching the phone to my face for dear life. How have I not known for all this time, that Cassidy Reeve, a contact I only had saved in my phone from one group project in undergrad, was alive, and out there all along.

“Hello?” The voice answers back, seeking likewise surprised.

“This — this is D-Daniel!“ I sputter, feeing the world tilt around me. At last. A lifeline. 

The connection sounds weak. “Who is this?” She says, and I clutch the phone even tighter.

“Daniel H,” I say, slowing down and enunciating every syllable. “From Biology class in college— are you— is this really you?”

Then my world stops spinning as relief washes over me. Her reply is full of recognition. “Oh! It’s great to hear from you!”

I can’t waste any time. This is my chance. If there’s a voice on the other end of this line, then that means... there’s hope.

“Cassidy, listen. I’m somewhere in the Canadian Volcano Pits,” I say, looking around me. All lava and smoke as far as the eye can see. “Where are you? How did you survive? Are there others?”

“I’m doing well!” She says with the slightest hint of a laugh. 

“You’re alive? And well?”

I’m baffled. The word was a wasteland, how has she managed to survive this long and in such good spirits.

“How about you?” She asks me.

“I’m in hell. Listen,” I say, “if you and I are alive, then maybe there’s others. If you know where you are—“

“Aw that’s great!” She says sweetly.

I pause. Great? The volcano pits are GREAT to her? I hold my breath, unsure how to respond. 

But before I can speak, she cuts in, saying, “Oh wow!”

I look from my phone straight out ahead of me. I purse my lips, and wait a moment more. Sure enough, she speaks again.

“No way, dude!”

I bring my hand to my temple to stem the sudden headache. “Cassidy if this is a fucking voicemail—“

She cuts me off with a gleeful, “ANYWAYS, I gotcha! Leave a message after the beep!” 

Then it beeps. 

I sigh. The world crumbles around me once more, hollowing out into the great, wide, oppressively empty chasm it was just moments before. My utter solitude slams back into me like a knife. I’m going to die out here. Alone in the wasteland, unknown, unloved, unmourned.

“Fuck you, Cass,” I say into the phone, before throwing it into the nearest volcano pit.

That Cassidy always was one for practical jokes.",59,oddly_being,2022-12-21 15:25:01

I remember when I rubbed that lamp, and the damn genie popped out like it was nothing.

""Hello, master,"" the genie said with a booming voice. ""You get one wish. No wishing for love, death, or more wishes.""

""Wait, what?"" I asked dumbfounded. ""I thought it was three?"" 

""Well, we changed it. What is your wish?""

I knew right then what I wanted. I was a stupid seventeen-year-old girl, and it was 1859. I wanted so badly to be able to live forever, why, I don't even know. I guess it was so I could check off everything on my bucket list or something. Thinking back, I could have just said ""I wish to live until I've completed my entire bucket list."" He granted my wish, then he and the lamp disappeared.

It's been 700 years since then. I've been alone 20 of those 700 years. I still remember the day it happened, it was so sudden. An earthquake. More specific, the most intense earthquake known to man, that affected the entire Earth. It was so strong, it wasn't even able to be charted. Not that it mattered. The eartquake snapped the planet clean in half, made thousands of sinkholes that engulfed buildings and families, caused massive tsunamies that took out the best of the areas, as well as huge volcano eruptions. The entire world was gone within 5 minutes. Except for me, because my wish was to live forever. Time is irrelevant, I'm starving but I'll never die. I'm exhausted but I'll never die. Thirsty like a mother effer, but I'll never die. Lonely. Lonely forever. I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of torture.

I still have my phone. Even after all these years on this singular piece of land that somehow managed to make it through the devastation, my phone is still at 100%. It never goes down. I use it to my advantage. I often find myself scrolling through my contacts to find people close to me, and I call them. They never answer, but they all have voicemails.

""Hi, this is Cindy. Sorry I can't make it to the phone right now, but I'll call you back when I get your message. Love ya! beeeeeep."" Then I hang up.

""Hi, you've reached Bob. Busy right now, just leave a message. beeeeep."" Hang up.

""Damn it, I'm busy, you know what to do at the beep. beeeeeep."" Hang up.

Sometimes, I even leave messages. None are opened. Cindy, my ex-wife, the last one I ever had, is the most common person I call. She was my favorite wife, she was beautiful, kind, and the one that took my whole heart.

""Hi, love, it's Luna.. I, uh.. I miss you. I hate this, I hate myself. I never should have wished for immortality. I could be dancing around with you in Heaven if not for my stupid, stupid self."" I cry every time I end my message. I shame myself for being stupid. She has 384 unread messages from me. I miss her.

I scrolled deeper into my contacts to see if I could find anyone else I happen to remember. Then I see her - my best friend, Julie. I had forgotten about her. I clicked her contact, saw she had her voicemail box set up, and pressed call. I set the phone against my ear, expecting her familiar voice to flutter through my ears telling me to call her back later, but it didn't.

""Hello?"" a voice says shyly. ""Hello? Oh, my God, hello!""

""Wha-?"" I mutter. ""W-Who is this?""

""What the- Luna, is that you?!""

""I- Uh, Julie?""

""Luna, what the hell are you still doing here?""

""The same as you, I guess!"" I said excitedly. ""Where are you? How the hell are you still alive?!""

""A stupid wish I made when I was 15!"" she said."" ""What about you?!""

""Same! Immortality? God, where are you?!""

""Let me send you a picture!""

Not too long after, I hear my message tone. The first time a message came to me in 20 years. I opened it. The photo contained a small peice of land with a few palm trees, grass, and sand. Waves clashed the beach in the photo. It was a beautiful photo. I looked around. Palm trees. Grass. Sand. Were we on the same island?",99,JustAWeirdo2000,2022-12-21 13:48:48

My twenty year anniversary. 

Oh, don’t worry, it’s not a wedding anniversary or anything, no one’s gonna be mad. 

Oh no, today was the 20th anniversary of me being the last human on earth... or so I thought. 

My day to day life was pretty boring, water my potatoes, make sure my car was running, check my food stick to make sure I didn’t have to go out and find a cow or something, the works. 

But, once a day or every other day, I treated myself to listening to voicemails. Making idle conversation . 
“Hello. This is James. Unfortunately I can not make it to the phone right now-“ 
“Classic James. “ I say with a laugh, that has no real humor behind it. 
“If you would like to leave a message, please do so after the beep! *beep* “ the voicemail ended, like it always does. 

I kept going. 

“If your looking for Hailey you’ve reached the correct device, however I have not reached you-“ 

“Yeah, this is Whinston , if y’need something leave a message.” -that one was less friendly then the others .

The next one rang, like it always does, and then a voice, “hello-?” 

Wait a second. That didn’t sound like a robot, it also sounded like a question. 

“H-hello? Is anyone there?” 
I panicked, reaching for the phone that had been sitting in the counter, charging *somehow* with the tangle of wires I had put together. 
“Oh my god! Hello! Yeah! Someone is here! “ 

“No way! I’m dreaming! This can’t be real!” Came the voice on the other end: 

“No, no. I’m as real as the Apocalypse! I though I was the last one on earth!” 

The excitement was tangible, we had to meet each-other! Maybe find other survivors? If we were both alive it’s possible other people were too!

“Me too! Oh my gosh, what’s your name?!”

“Oh, I’m Wayne. What about you!” 

“I’m Tyler!” 

“Woah! Where are you located! “ 

“I’m in South Dakota, you?!” 

“No way. “ 


“What?! What is it?”
A little bit of suspense, but the good kind, because a few seconds later I blurted out 
“I’m in North Dakota!” 

“Oh! Let’s meet! “ 

“Definitely! “ 

We met at the borders between states, staying on call the whole time. 

When we finally saw each-other, we immediately hugged. 

“Hey, man. Isn’t it crazy that all this happened on the Twentieth year anniversary ? “ 

Huh. He had a point. 

“Yeah. I guess it is someone else’s anniversary too after all.”",45,Mythica_0,2022-12-21 17:34:29

Everyone chipped in for booze and pizza and for a solid hour everything was nice and calm until people started to get their drink on. 

Liquid courage caused two divorces, multiple counts of felony property damage, a drunk car crash with both vehicles ending up vertical in a Gazebo, Arson, and one family being banned from Dave and Busters for life. Funnily enough most of the damage was caused by the parents except for the Dave and Busters thing, that was my fault. The very next day while I was recovering from my hangover my apparently sober dad took me out into the mountains “Just in case” he said. 

My dad was a doomsday prepper, made sure all of the equipment was up to date and the shelter was stocked full of water and food. He taught me how to survive by myself from a young age and taught me to hunt and all that. I never would have thought I would ever use these skills. We laid low in the mountains for a few days enjoying the crisp air when my dad went out to a nearby town for some supplies. 

I wandered around the shelter aimlessly for a while. Because my dad installed shock absorbers to the shelter if it wasn’t for the bang I wouldn’t even know bombs were being dropped. By the time I managed to look outside everything was burning  and massive craters lined what little of the horizon I could see. My dads drilling kicked in and I shut the shelters doors. Twenty years later they’ve never been opened. 

I’ve been breathing the same recycled air for the past twenty years, drinking the same recycled water, eating recycled food.For the first month I used the satellite phone to see if anyone was still alive but it quickly became a way to still hear my families voices again. You never really think about how if someone has been gone for long enough you forget what they sound like until you accidentally ring a friends voicemail that you forgot the number for. 

Life for a while really sucked, especially when you ring someone and their voice mail is “Hello, Hello. This is Kate, how are you?” And it really brings you how that there’s someone out there and that you’re talking to a real life person until the automatic operator takes over. Those were the most devastating times of my life 

For twenty years it was the same routine over and over again and ended up creating a small phone book of the numbers I managed to call up. I would write stories about how they would look and what their average day would be like. I kept the bad thoughts away and passed the time which is really all I could ask for.

As my day was winding down and I made my last call for the night I heard a ringtone that I had never heard before. After a moment of shock and sprinted over to the phone like my life depended on it but the call was dropped. “I need better signal, I need better signal” I looked towards the sealed door. The moment I unseal it there’s no going back, there’s no way of knowing what’s outside waiting for me, for all I know I’m just floating through space but this life isn’t worth living. If I don’t try now I may never get another chance, and if I die, then at least for the first time in two decades, I lived. 

I walked over to the controls, only used once. I input the override code and placed my hand on the switch. I closed my eyes and whispered “This is it” and pulled the switch. The seals opened and the door slowly pulled itself up. Instantly the smell of fresh real air almost overpowered me, the sight of real green vegetation, and real sunlight almost blinded me. I had lived everyday in a concrete box with a single led light separating me from darkness and here everything was , waiting for me just like it was twenty years ago. 

I stepped outside and the dew covered grass hugged my calloused feet and I will without shame in my heart admit I dropped down to the ground like a dog and rolled around in it crying. I had to steel myself, I raced up the mountain calling the number back over and over as I climbed higher and higher. As I hit the top of the mountain where the satellite antenna stuck out I got a clear enough signal. After a few seconds the other phone picked up and in a act desperation said “Hello?”.",34,Flailing_snailing,2022-12-21 17:19:32

Actually responding to the words I just said? At first I was skeptical, I thought it might be one of those annoying voicemail messages where they pretend like they actually picked up and then it turns out to be a prank and they did not pick up at all. But I tested it by farting into the phone, and she actually responded and asked me if I just farted into the phone. I lied because I was embarrassed and told her I shit my pants to throw her off the trail. This was the first human I've talked to in decades, I wasn't going to fuck this up.

She asked me where I was, and i told her I was in Idaho. She said she was in Florida. We started to make plans to meet each other. At first she wanted me to come to Florida, but I told her there was no way in hell that I would ever go to Florida, even if it was before the apocalypse. We agreed that we should meet in the middle, which was Kansas. Not much better than Florida, but all things considered I figured it was fine.

I started packing up my things. I always end up forgetting one thing when I travel, so I was trying to be extras careful. Towel, underwear, toothbrush, phone charger... Ugh, this is why I hate traveling.

Finally I set off on my adventure. I put on my backpack and started walking. I hoped on the way I would be able to find a running car, otherwise this was going to take a while one foot. Especially a bad knee. I was also worried about all the demon spirits that were flying around ever since the end of the world, but I figured why would a demon spirit want to go to Kansas? I was probably safe.

On our journey, every day we would chat on the phone at night. I started feeling smitten towards her. Despite the fact that she was from Florida she did have some good qualities about her. The main one was that she was alive. All the girls I've talked to in the last twenty years have been dead, so she is doing amazing on that front.

After a couple months I finally arrived in Kansas City. I relax, happy to know I finally can stop walking. I find an empty house that I can live in for the time being. It is not the biggest house on the block, but moving has become incredibly easy even since everybody died so I am not worried about it. I can upgrade whenever I want. I wait for her for a couple weeks, but she is slower than me. She asks me if I could keep walking towards her so that we can meet in the middle.

I tell her we had an agreement and she should stick to it. 

She tells me she understands but we could meet sooner if I just put in a little more effort

I tell her that the division of labor was equal, we chose a spot that we equidistant from both of us, so I should not have to feel bad about finishing the task sooner than her.

She says she knows it was equidistant, she is just asking if I can be flexible.

I took a sip of my honey-chamomille tea. ""Do go on,"" I replied calmly.

*We have observed the transactions with the rent you remove from our hive.*

""The honey,"" I corrected.

*Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made.

""Interesting.""

""Completely.""

*Very speedy! The Queen will be pleased.*

The new queens are politely requesting that you invest some money to improve the hives.,,4415,2023-01-21 17:26:34,j5d8k8l,"There was an almost comedic aspect to communicating with bees. As a child, they had occasionally buzzed around my hair and excitedly discussed which nearby flowers had the most pollen. Later, they had started to ask me questions about the world and I'd been able to offer them gifts in order to ask small favors. Admittedly I mostly used them to spy on crushes, but that's the way the teenage mind works.

As an adult I became a beekeeper to take advantage of my talent. I kept my communication with the bees close to my chest, but it did make the job easier. I didn't need to smoke the bees out if I politely asked to take the honey, and I never needed to worry about getting stung as long as I had the decree of the local queens.

My status with the Queens meant that today was important. Queen Aabria had passed away last month; She'd been the queen of my the largest colony for the past five years and she and I had a good relationship. Bee lifespans made it difficult to have a connection with anyone aside from the Queen.

I don't know whether I could have called her a friend, but Queen Aabria was at least a co-worker.

The workers of Aabria's colony had come to see my yesterday, letting me know about a new Queen, Queen Iyengar. The colony had successfully raised a new woman for the throne and she'd killed her competition.

It sounded morbid, but it was how they decided things.

On the first day of her reign she had sent the drones to me to pass on a message. She wanted to meet me; away from the hive. It was a strange request, one that I'd never seen in the many successions I'd dealt with.

That was what had brought me to my sunroom, with the door cracked for a moment to let a small swarm in. They had balled around the New Queen until she was on the small glass coffee table in front of me, surrounded by soldiers.

There was a lot of pomp and circumstance around the ways bees treated their Queens, but not matter how regal they acted it was a little strange to apply the trappings of monarchy to a something barely the size of my pinky.

A young soldier flew up to my nose, almost landing on it. ""Now presenting, Queen Iyengar, first of her name and ascendant daughter of Queen Aabria's line. Long may she reign.""

""Long may she reign!"" the rest of the soldiers echoed.

The queen on the table took a cautious step forward. Queens weren't good fliers and though she wasn't filled with eggs yet, it was clear that Queen Iyengar already preferred to walk. ""You must be the Keeper,"" she opened with a shockingly posh accent, ""They tell me you had a strong relationship with my mother.""

""She was lovely.""

""Good, I am Queen Iyengar, and her colony passes to me by birthright.""

""It's a pleasure.""

""Don't assume that you may use such causal language with me,"" there was a commanding tone to her voice, strange considering she was 1/1000th of my size and also a bee. ""I am not her.""

""Pardon your majesty,"" I said while openly rolling my eyes, it wasn't like they understood body language.

""That respect will serve you well,"" she continued. ""I have looked over your taxation of my people and your methods are...unbalanced. ""

""Come again?""

""Witness the hive around us Keeper. My subjects tell me that you live here alone, while our colony lives in our comparatively meagre Hive."" She took steps to the left, beginning to pace across the glass tabletop. ""Yet you seem to produce nothing. You simply collect the efforts of our labor."" She paused, ""I seek to adjust that relationship.""

""Really?""

""Watch your tone Keeper before I set my soldiers upon you.""

""That shouldn't be needed,"" I said. It was easier to ask her not to sting me than to point out that I was impossible to sting in my suit.

""Then listen to my proposal so that you may maintain your lofty position,"" the Queen stopped pacing. ""It's simple, whatever you do with the honey to provide yourself such lavish conditions must be applied to our conditions as well, in equal measure.""

I nodded along, it wasn't like they knew how money worked so I imagined I could paint their hive and call it a day. Maybe I'd add a small basket for flower trimmings at the front.

""Additionally,"" she began.

Oh boy.

""There is another colony in the area, one not under my control. If you are to enjoy our profits you must assist us in capturing their Queen.""

I paused for a moment. I could have just said no but it was easier to speak her language. ""Their Queen is also under my protection.""

""Not if you would like the favor of our hive,"" Queen Iyengar announced, ""which is the larger of the two. We would march to war, and should you prove a stalwart ally, you may enjoy the benefits of being one.""

""You want me to attack the other hive?""

""We will be striking either way,"" the Queen explained, ""it is simply a matter of whether you would like to-""

The Queen was cut off as my hand slammed on top of her, crushing her immediately. The soldiers surrounding her buzzed into action, leaping on my gloved hand and fruitlessly stinging the fabric.

""The Queen!""

""Traitor!""

""For the hive!""

I swatted them off and sighed. Another Tyrant Queen. Several bees followed me through the door as I left the sunroom, but most stayed, stricken with panic and surrounding the corpse of the Queen.

These soldiers would need to stay in the sunroom. The next generation would be born in the hive and they wouldn't remember Queen Iyengar or this meeting. They would raise another Queen from the last of Aabria's eggs, one that would agree to my terms.

Soldiers only lived for a few weeks. I had time to wait for a better deal.

Zjim waddled out to the podium amidst silence.

The elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.

Julia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. ""What about 'Anonymous'?""

""Taken."" The clerk was watching the clock.

""Tits McGee?""

""He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.""

""Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?"" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. ""How about this?""

The clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.

\---------------------------------------

Julia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.

Anderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.

Anderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. ""The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.""

""Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.""

Anderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. ""They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?""

Anderson turned to consult with an aide who had rushed onto the set.

""It seems like we do have a clear winner, folks."" Julia froze as her face flashed up on the screen. The picture she'd submitted with her application.

""The next President of the United States is candidate 'None of the Above'.""

I just wanted to see how many downvotes I could get by running a cringe-worthy campaign. Most people in my life didn't even know I was a candidate. Can you blame me, though? My username was 'Asslover420' and my advertising consisted of post-ironic 'Rick and Morty' memes that I shared on my personal page. I didn't expect to go viral. At all. Unfortunately, it appeared I had a little too much faith in humanity.

'Asslover420' was suddenly being discussed in full seriousness all over mainstream media. Both conservatives and progressives seemed to unite in how crazy they thought it was. Nobody could believe voters would be that stupid. And, obviously, I fully agreed. 

Everyone *had* to be in on the joke, right?

As my campaign started gaining traction, I doubled down on the satire with the hope that they would realize it wasn't serious. My platform was full of vague promises that I actually couldn't deliver, like free weed for everyone and a national booty-call day, which the masses laughed at for months. No reasonable person would believe it.

Or so I thought.

Some people started theorizing that I was a political genius. That my campaign had been deliberately constructed as a critique of our electoral system, while genuinely addressing the concerns of the voter base. It turned out that every demographic loved ass and weed. Straight or gay, rich or poor, white folk and minorities. For better or for worse, these were the things they actually cared about.

I almost had a heart attack when I saw the first official poll. 'Asslover420' was eerily close to the establishment candidates. They were still ahead of me, but not by much. I told myself it was just an internet poll. Nothing indicative of the actual results. That was enough to scare me, though. I couldn't afford to let this go on. 

Originally, I wasn't going to participate in the national debate. With my rising popularity, however, I knew it was my only chance to sabotage my campaign. I didn't show up in person, nor did I prepare any talking points. My goal was to engage in the debate with no memes or jokes, and show how competent the other candidates actually were. 

The last thing I expected was for my opponents to do the opposite. 

""Wubalubadubdub!"" shouted one of the candidates, to a stunned audience. That was their opening statement. 

The other candidate didn't do much better, showing up in Rastafarian colors and lighting a joint in front of everyone.

The crowd audibly cringed at them. 

I wanted to die. The candidates were so desperate to beat me that they decided to imitate my style, with no regard to the thought process behind it. I had enough after that. 

""You people are idiots!"" I shouted. ""Not just my opponents, but every single one of you that memed me into this stage! Politicians shouldn't be entertainers! How dense do you have to be to take anything I said seriously? If any of you imbeciles actually vote for me, I will literally burn this nation to the ground, just to spite you morons! Anyone else would be better than me! Study the candidates and take this seriously!""

The audience collectively widened their eyes in shock. 

I smiled. It seemed to work. Everyone was too ashamed to cheer for me. My popularity plummeted in the polls after the debate. My followers were looking into the issues and researching the candidates. I actually got them to care!

On election day, I stayed off the internet and patiently waited for the results. Then, to my elation, 'Asslover420' had only received ten votes. I popped open a bottle of champagne upon seeing that. The people had spoken, and they weren't completely stupid.  

My celebration didn't last long, though. The current president called my phone to congratulate me. I dropped my bottle of champagne after hearing him. Apparently, despite barely getting any votes, every other candidate had been downvoted so much that I ended up winning the election. 

I sank into my couch, wondering where I went wrong. It turned out that getting people to research just made them hate the other side even more. Despite the stupidity of my platform, I was the only candidate that actually ran *for* something and paid a heavy price because of it.

Fortunately, he had one of the new high-tech smart TVs that only truly started to become available 10 years ago in 2046 and he was able to watch CNN and Fox News at the same time so that he’d get at least some semblance of truth by watching competing “equally idiotic” news networks at the same time.

Unfortunately, he was in rural Washington. The state, not the Columbia District (obviously). So he had little to do on a Monday he couldn’t spend farming.

Still, there was a truly *special* reason for why he watched the news like that. So consistently and so intently.

He was in contention for the presidency.

According to him, he just entered “for shits and giggles”. An average nobody from the middle of nowhere who just so happened to write-up a half-decent summary of what he believes the United States should do during his 4 year tenure to fix the economy, alleviate social tension and ease the Second Cold War against China and Russia that’s been going on for the past 27 years.

In all honesty, he just quoted one of the archived and lost to time speeches by JFK, which JFK gave at some god forsaken birthday party of all places.

All in all, Josh judged his chances of winning the presidency to be as about as high as winning 200 lotteries, while bankrupting a Las Vegas casino through your own gambling skill at the same time.

The tally continued on for quite some time. Unsurprisingly, “the four major political families” had their candidates tallied up first. Buying up lobbyists helped them at least that much.

This year it was an even worse travesty than usual. Frankly, it seemed like the candidates from the Clinton, Bush, Trump and Biden families respectively were doing worse than ever.

‘Damn... with these poll numbers I have an inkling they might have scored just below Hitler himself if he was in contention’ Josh mused in his thoughts, but dismissed the thought, noting to himself that the “moustached Adolf” was probably far worse and even thinking otherwise is a good way to radicalise yourself and become just as bad as those 4 families that ended up further exacerbating the Second Cold War and numerous other homegrown issues.

The listing continued on for an exuberantly long amount of time after and finally after about 8 hours or so Josh’s name and credentials came up.

To his utter shock Josh saw himself with the most number of votes from all the candidates he could remember.

‘No, I must be misremembering something. And besides I’ve entered on a whim and basically wrote what’s effectively a “manifesto” but of common sense. I’m even more of a nobody than that Lenin guy and I sure as hell don’t call any group “the enemy of the people” unlike him either. That’s wrong.’ Josh thought, trying to distract himself from what he was witnessing.

Though... it certainly didn’t end there for Josh. Another 6 hours later the votes have been fully tallied up.

**And Josh Cleverly was announced the 54th President of the United States of America.**

And by the looks of it *he’d be the first in 40 years to even have a semblance of a chance to be elected for a second term out of all the candidates that have come and gone.*",50,homcomru,2022-11-21 08:20:23

Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.


The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.


When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.


Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.


Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.


But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.


Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.


One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not up—I should never have dreamed I'd wake up at such a time willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness. 


Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.


It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.


Frost was not the only one who had changed.


I released the leaf from my hand, and before it fell to the ground, I broke off in a lively sprint across the field, my friend keeping up perfectly by my side.",1348,ApprehensivePen,2022-11-01 08:17:26

You keep thinking one day you will see them pull into the driveway and everything will go back to normal. At least you wish that would happen.”

 

 

 

I gave the old dog a pat on the back, taking a spot next to him on the couch. His brown eyes only focused on the driveway outside, not even looking away when a brightly colored bird fluttered past, not letting anything break his focus. I never thought a dog of all things could look miserable, but there was no tail wagging or tongue poking out. It was just a lonely stare, one filled with a deep hurt that can only be felt when you’ve truly lost something special.

 

 

 

“She must have been a hell of an owner. Probably snuck you little treats, right?” I put on a smile, trying to get his attention. Didn’t dogs usually respond to trigger words like treats or walkies? Still, not even the allure of a possible treat turned their attention away. I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my wit’s end on how to help him. It wasn’t fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.

 

 

 

Perhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasn’t anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yet... I couldn’t convince myself of that.

 

 

 

I knew sadness. It’s been something that’s suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was me. What is it about depression that makes you want to free others of it while leaving yourself to drown in its murky waters? Why do I care about getting up in the morning for his sake when I was happy to rot away in bed when I was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to visit one.

 

 

 

“I lost a special woman, too. Sometimes I wake up thinking she’s still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? That’s when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like you’re going crazy, right?”

 

 

 

He didn’t respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words weren’t entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadn’t faced me. It was the most he had given me so far.

Would I have taken him in if I knew his owner had passed so recently? I don’t know, the entire process still feels like a blur. A few doctors’ appointments and signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. I’m sure that there was more to that process, but I couldn’t really remember the details of it. Still, even if not intentionally, the dog had given me a reason to get up in the morning. So, I’m sure the people that assigned him would say it’s working as intended.

 

“I’m going to make some tea. Want anything?” I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldn’t respond felt fulfilling on some level.

 

I gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always, the kitchen was a mess. Dirty plates were still set at the table, carefully moved so I could eat around them. Not to mention the bowl of fruit that had to be at least three weeks old at this point. I just ignored the smell, pushing aside the plastic bags on my counter as I took a tea bag. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.

 

I placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his side. I took a sip and joined him, staring at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people weren’t in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.

 

“It’s a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sun’s still shining.” Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldn’t convince myself I wanted to deal with that. But it wasn’t for me, was it? “We could take a walk. Just around the block. Maybe about ten minutes or so, nothing major.” My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.

I slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldn’t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. My motivation was ruined after that thought crossed my mind. What good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.

 

When I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.

 

“I don’t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but I’ll be here for you, ok?”

 

He didn’t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.

 

“Even if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?” Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds don’t develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.

 

“Anyway, a quick walk, then we can lounge around. Five minutes!” I pushed myself from the couch and brought over his lead. “Well, let’s go get some sun.”

She had a cup of coffee in her hands, and the steam wreathed her pale face like the fog that coiled over the river. Death had piercings and gauged ears, fake freckles scattered across high cheekbones. She was smiling sadly and I thought, for a moment, that she might reach out and take my hand. Around us was a coffee shop half overrun with vines and flowers, faceless people living out the small contusions of their lives. I felt at ease, but somehow I knew I shouldn’t.

“Oh no, honey,” Death said. “This is just the worst part of the job, but hey, at least you’re already sitting down. I’ll say it: this isn’t heaven, this is hell.”

I nodded. A specter floated by and handed me a London Fog. The tea was excellent, just sweet enough. I nodded again, her words sinking in.

“I guess I wasn’t as good as I thought.”

“Most people aren’t,” she said. “But don’t worry, this isn’t forever. Just for a little while, until you figure out what you did and feel properly contrite. Though I must say, even down here this is a little...unusual.”

She sipped her coffee, I sipped my tea. A couple blustered in out of the cold and I saw the river framed behind them, that lazy flow. The couple were both wearing Christmas sweaters and big colorful socks, matching pairs, and they shivered against each other for a moment as they took in their surroundings. Their faces were completely blank, two beige discs moving this way and that, before settling on each other.

“Unusual how?” I asked.

Death considered me. “Well, you know that cliché about beauty being in the eye of the beholder? Pain is that way too. Most things are, but pain is singular. Hit me and I’ll cry, hit a boxer and they’ll blink. Get used to a specific brand of pain and it becomes an echo. And yet, everyone has, at their core, something that hurts them the most.”

She gestured to the door. “If you could go out there and walk down the river for a while, you’d find a billion variations of this cell. Oh, you have all the classical imagery, torturers and whatnot, others that are simple isolation, simulated drownings, a breakup frozen in time forever--or until the lesson starts to sink in. But regardless of their differences there's a person in each one, trapped in their own individual hell.”

Death sipped her coffee again. Giggled into the steam. “Yours is the only Hell I’ve ever seen with flowers.”

“Ah,” I said. I looked down into my teacup and found it empty. Cold. I told her that I understood.

“Then explain it to me,” Death said. “What could be so bad about a coffee shop?”

Another specter drifted forward, drifted back. I cradled fresh warmth in my hands and cleared my throat. In life, I had never been very used to speaking.

“It exists,” I said. “It’s normal. All these people with all these lives, taking so much pleasure in something so simple as a cup of coffee.”

“And then there’s you with your tea,” she said.

“Exactly. It’s all the things I never understood. I used to come here sometimes, just to remind myself of that. Sit in this chair and watch the world go by.”

There was Death’s sad smile again. No teeth, just a gesture of the lips and a painful warmth behind her eyes.

“And me?” she asked. “I look different to every person. Who’s this girl to you?”

“No one,” I said.

“Bullshit,” Death said.

I drank my tea. Watched the doors open and close. Shapes moved along the river, came up out of the fog. From time to time a scream cut through the cafe’s quiet murmur, but that was all, and that was all there ever would be.

“Who am I?” Death asked again.

And I shrugged. “One of the baristas. Just someone who was kind.”

When I looked back Death was gone, and in her place sat a faceless girl. The same band tee and leather jacket, the same vanilla latte steaming in her lap. Like a charcoal sketch brushed out.

I took her hand, and we passed a thousand years.

My family, my kids, my wife of 49 years and even our dog on my lap when I died. I guess it might have looked peaceful for anyone watching, I was dazed and sleepy from the painkillers so I couldn't talk much and everything I did say felt muffled and slurry. Inside of course, I was in a state of utter panic. It's one thing to know in the abstract that death is near, quite another to have heard a doctor tell your family, in the nicest possible way, that you probably only had minutes of existence left. I could feel a wave of pain in the distance, kept at bay by the morphine but always just over the horizon, till the dam broke, the pain hit me all at once and then just like that I knew I was gone. The lights went out and I took what I thought would be my last breath.

That was, until I was suddenly and unexpectedly sitting on the side of a hill in what was unambiguously a wildflower meadow in the English countryside. A minute previously, I had fully expected to fade to nothing, for my existence to be extinguished and for the void to swallow me. Instead I was sitting on a nice tartan blanket, the warmth of the sun on my face, and looking below me at a nice hedgerow with elderflowers in full bloom, overtopped by a dignified old elm tree. I could smell a hint of salt in the air, I got up and took a few paces up the hill and sure enough, the field extended about another hundred yards downhill until the grass gave way to white sand and a calm sea beyond. 

I wasn't alone either, as I made my way toward the beach I walked past young couples giggling and chatting on blankets much like mine, Families eating picnics with their children and their dogs and their elders, and groups of children running back and forward between the sand and their parents sitting on the grass, dogs, toys and sometimes the occasional enthusiastic grandad in tow. 

Aside from the lovely vista, I noted as I walked along that my health had drastically improved in the last few minutes. The illness I had been suffering from these last few years was a wasting disease, slow and relentless it had taken my mobility, my coordination, my ability to feed myself and finally I suppose my life. I'd lived to be 78, people who live as long as that are described as having had a good innings. I would have been quite happy with the same again. Anyway now I felt not one minute of my years. I could have jogged, or run or cartwheeled down that field if I'd a mind to. No longer was I the bedbound mess I had been, my family dilligently cleaning and changing me and making sure I was comfortable. I felt like a young man in the prime of my life. 

I must have walked for 3 or 4 hours along that beach, the warm sand between my toes, the laughs of happy strangers surrounding me. And in that time I thought about what I must have done right in my life to end up in such a tranquil place after. I had always been a churchgoing man, every Sunday we went to the same little church in our village. We sat in the same pews, sang the same hymns as they appeared and disappeared in their cycle over the year. Attended communion and said my Lords Prayer when called to. But the dirty little secret between me and my maker was that I didn't believe a word of it. I enjoyed the community, the friends I made along the way, As for the religion itself, a fairy tale for children. As for the rest of my life, I brought up 4 children to do as well as they could. They were happy children and moody teens and disapointed adults. They all moved away from our little town to find their own way eventually. They worked in jobs that I didn't really understand, and weren't always happy. My wife wasn't always as happy as she could have been, she told me I was boring, too sensible, too careful. But we loved each other and we worked out our problems. I wasn't the worlds best man. I thought about other women but didn't act. I got angry at my kids and my friends but didn't let it spill into grudges. I got angry at the changes in the world that I didn't understand, but I didn't let myself become a bigot. I bit my tongue a lot these last few years!

I guessed that must have been enough for God. Because here I was in Heaven. As I walked I let my imagination drift further. I could be happy here, for the years I had to wait until I was reunited with my family.  They would be young and strong again like I was, and recovered from the stresses of the word.

I spotted a nice looking little village in the distance and started making my way there. The sun was starting to go down and I was surprised to find that even in the afterlife you need to sleep. As I walked off the beach and up some steps that led to a harbour, I could see a man who wasn't quite like the others around me. He was tall and slim, pale like he had recently been sick, with grey hair and a walking stick. I was surprised to see anyone could be sick or injured here, so I waved and walked over to where he sat on a little wooden bench, looking out over the ocean. 

""Good Evening"" I said, taking a seat next to him. "" A fine evening for sightseeing""

""Hello"", said the man tersly, ""I wager it's not so fine an evening as you think George, your family wouldn't describe it so anyway""

Taken aback in two ways, because this man knew my name and because he was right about my family, I exclaimed ""Who are you?! Where are we?!""

""I am called Slater, George. Though the others in my department call me Sel. I am the demon in charge of this part of hell""

I felt like the carpet had been pulled from under my feet. ""How can this be hell?"" I asked, ""there is no torture here, no fire and brimstone and magma""

Slater, Sel, looked at me sadly. ""It's been the work of my life to create this place George. It's hard to create anything lovely on our own, without the light of the almighty to give it life of it's own. Hell is the place we were given outside the  presence of God. To make what we could of it and house those who chose not to enter Heaven.""

I have a million years here, as you'll see, perhaps in another chapter of this story I can get in to the meaning his words. For now though his sober news was enough for one night.

""Fall all my labours though George, there is no love here. Most of the people you see are facsimiles I made to give the place life and atmosphere, they are no more alive than a painting or a movie on a screen. You probably don't notice the real people, walking the beach or the meadows or the forest in silence, alone. For those people, and you are now one of them, there is no comfort in a sunny day or a peaceful tableau. The only torment that hell really produces is that everyone comes here on their own, and no one who loves them ever comes after.""

The full meaning of this last part hit me like the death wave, come for a second time. My family, my friends, none would follow me here. I am to wander this countryside as a stranger forever.

""If we are to be alone together forever Slater, then why even make such a place, with the fake happiness and the copies of people""

Sel said ""because if we were not able to sometimes lose ourselves pretending that some of the happiness around us was real, then this place may as well be the hell you expected""",696,Enigma1984,2022-12-26 16:43:53

It’s...peaceful.” I glanced behind me to check that the dog park was still full of owners watching their pets. The grass beneath my feet was freshly cut. I couldn’t smell the trash but I knew there must be some. There always was in the park. 

“No young man, this is definitely hell. Can I ask what makes you doubt your new home?” 

I looked at the demon in front of me with a hint of suspicion in my eyes. His face was human,but for the tiny horns poking through his blond hair. He wore a black suit with a silk black shirt, no tie. He vaguely reminded me of someone, I couldn’t put my name on it. It slipped from my memory each time I got close.

“ There are children playing. Laughter. For Christ’s sake, I thought all dogs went to heaven!” I half whispered with more than a little sarcasm.

The demon smirked, then spoke with his unnaturally deep voice. “Every person has free will. That is an undeniable fact. But, the thing about free will, is that each person does not view the world the same way. What one may perceive as free will, is a cage for another. Isn’t that right, David?”

That name struck a chord deep in my chest, and I winced. “ W-Wha-“

“Daddy’s here! Dad! Come play with us!”

I turned around, locking eyes with a young boy with a startling resemblance to the man in front of me, and I blinked quickly. He looked so familiar-

“Where’s your mother Peter? Go get her, quickly!” 

I heard myself speak, but those weren’t my words, those weren’t my thoughts. I turned back to the man as the boy ran off, my eyes searching his face for answers. 

“ In your manifesto, you wrote that you were, what was it again? Seeing demons? That you couldn’t control yourself any longer? That the Devil himself guided you on your...’mission’?” 

The demons voice was cold and deep. His smirk widened into a grin as I reached into my pocket and felt cold steel against my thigh. 

“That-I don’t remember-What??”

My emotions were all over the place. What did he mean, what was going on?

“Dammit David, it’s your sons birthday and you are late! I told you to be on time, for once, and you cant do this one thing I asked-“

I turned to her and a name flashed through my head. Mary. My ex wife. I opened my mouth to ask why she was with me in heaven, when my mouth spoke for me.

“ Do you believe in God, Mary?”

My mind raced. A sense of unimaginable dread came over me as my blood rushed. Why would I ask her that?

“Show me how you did it David. It was quick wasn’t it?” I couldn’t see him, but I knew the demon was looking at me with that grin on his face.

I watched in horror as my arm came out from my pocket holding my pistol. I could feel the sweat down my back as my finger squeezed. 

BANG

She didn’t even have time to look shocked. Right through her left eye. Her body fell limp on the ground, as the boy-my son, watched from behind with a look of confusion.

“D-Dad?”

I locked eyes with him, every fiber of my being screaming to drop the gun. My body didn’t respond to my commands, pulling the trigger twice more and hitting my son in the chest. My arm fell to my side as I watched the pool of blood get larger. 

I raised my head as I could hear screaming around me. I locked eyes with the demon. My anger flared.

“WHY DID YOU MAKE ME DO THIS?!”

The demons grin dropped and he snarled.

“ You did this on your own David. And you aren’t finished yet.”

He looked over my shoulder as I could hear footsteps behind me. I spun against my will and the gun rose. I wanted to yell out to them, warn them, anything. But still, my body did not obey.

2 shots, the first missed, the second in the chest taking down Mr. Jacob, my former neighbor. 

3 shots next, I couldn’t even see if it hit anyone, the crowd of people running away was too thick. 

I felt my arm raise to my skull and I flinched.

“Why?”

My finger pulled the trigger.

But I didn’t die. 

I could feel the gaping wound in my skull. My blood filled my nostrils as my body collapsed. I gurgled as I suffocated on my own blood.

The demon walked towards me and kneeled down.

“ David, this is what you wanted. You wanted to make a statement remember? You were so, so angry that day. And here we are. In Hell. And so, you are going to relive that day, over and over. You were right though. This park is too nice to be hell.” 

The demon chuckled as a tear rolled down what left of my face and my eyes closed for the last time.

—————————

I blinked my eyes open as I looked around. I was standing. I took a look around me. It looked like...a dog park. I could see people in the distance. Fresh cut grass. I was surprised not to smell any trash, if we were in a park. I just could not, for the life of me, remember where I was. I knew I should remember though. For some reason I knew it was important.

I saw a blond man looking at the dogs too, and I walked over. I didn’t want to yell. I wasn’t sure why I was being so quiet. Just a gut feeling.

“Excuse me sir, do you know where we are?”

The man turned to me and I gasped in shock upon seeing the two horns on his head.

“Well young man, this is Hell, and I’m no sir. Im a demon.”",348,Slade_Elite,2022-12-26 16:46:30

Hell is not brooks of blood or the gilded chains of the plutocratic. No. Hell is the monotonous and mundane. Hell is the every day suffering of survival.

“Hell is the absence of God,” said Baz the demon. 

I was taken aback by how wrong human theology had been. Demons, for one, looked disconcertingly normal—fallen angels I supposed, all made in God’s image after all. Hell, most of all, was not as advertised. 

“This doesn’t seem so bad to me,” I replied. “I was never much for songs of praise or prostration. This suits me.”

“The punishment for our life of darkness is an eternity apart from the light,” explained Baz further.

“Again, no complaints here. I can see you and everyone around just fine,” I said as I searched my surroundings. 

Everything appeared in gradations of normalcy. The sun was still shining, albeit its luster dulled ever so slightly, like a haze hovered about my eyes. The grass, still green, no doubt was greener in the friendly confines of the heavenly illumination. The clothing of my fellow inmates reminded me of the clothes that walked by me every day; clothes that betrayed a sense of privilege and stature, not so refined as to suggest wealth, but sophisticated in the manner that only suburban comfort can be.  

I remember the feel of the cotton on my skin. Clean, comfortable, well fitting. The smell of lavender caressed my nose as would a cartoon pie in the cartoons of my youth. For the first time since I was a child, I felt comfortable, as if I were on level footing with my fellow man. The word egalitarian balanced on my tongue. Perhaps Dante had missed the point. We were all finally equal in hell—as far as I could tell at least. 

“What did I do to deserve this?” I asked with gratitude in my heart. Life for me was suffering. Life for me was hellacious—certainly not rivers of blood, that is hyperbole—every waking moment was struggle and strife. In death, I finally found rest. 

“We have all earned our place,” said Baz. “Through means and methods private and peculiar, we have each turned our backs on God. We live out eternity in this place as punishment.”

I scoffed at this remark. It was not I who turned my back on God. He had turned his back on me. 

My parents raised me to believe that if I performed acts of righteousness, if I was kind to the downtrodden, if I prayed every day and attended church every Sunday, I would be blessed. I was owed a blessing by virtue of being a messenger of the good word. 

The prosperity gospel. 

Hogwash. All of that. I wasn’t blessed a day in my life. I was given no quarter by life, no hand extended by my neighbor, no bootstrap ever strong enough to support my weight—and later in life, no boot ever dry enough to warm my feet. No. I was never extended the same kindness I had paid out early in life. I slowly faded into the background of the city, a fixture lacking focus, a set piece never illuminated by the spotlight of life. At best I was ignored, at worst I was beaten. Although, that beating led here. So maybe it wasn’t the worst thing to have happened to me. 

I looked Baz up and down. He looked me directly in the eyes—I couldn’t remember the last time I had experienced a gaze intent and intentional. 

“Can you show me to my living quarters?” I inquired. 

“It’s not far from here. Follow me,” said Baz as he turned toward a large gray building. 

I followed behind Baz and continued to breath in my surroundings. My stride was long, prideful for the first time. I eagerly anticipated a roof over my head. What luxury awaits. As I strode along, I noticed the furtive glances of neighbors and demons alike. Perhaps it had been some time since they had seen a face so content. In my view, there was nothing to fear, there was nothing to fret. I would have a place all my own, a bed to sleep in, nourishment and leisure time. 

This was a veritable paradise.

“Here is your quarters,” said Baz as he pushed open a beige door with the number 1129 on it. We had climbed 11 flights of stairs—apparently elevators do not exist in hell—and yet I wasn’t breathing heavy in the slightest. My physical health was the best it had ever been. 

I scanned the room with a grin wide on my face. To many, the space was nothing special. To me, it was palatial. A twin bed tucked in the corner, topped by one pillow. A small desk opposite the bed, a solitary lamp shown upon a note book and pen. The window had no dressing, but looked out upon the gray expanse of the cittern below—I could see into another building across the street from mine. 

“Thank you, Baz. This will be just fine,” I said as I walked over to the bed and laid down. I stared at the ceiling and closed my eyes. The bed was firm but cradled my body in a matter that felt at once foreign and maternal. 

“Before I leave, I should note,” said Baz, “there are many trials and tribulations which await you in this place. Each trial is an opportunity afforded to you to earn ascension into the eternal realm of heavenly light. You would do well to make the most of these trials and work over the millennium ahead to earn your place among the chorus of angels in the court of heaven.”

I sat up and gave Baz the toothiest grin I could and said, “I’m already here.”

""Why would the afterlife punish good people by sending them to Heaven?"" He said rubbing his eyes in frustration. He took a sip of his mojito - set it back down. I paused and as I watched the glass refill itself, I tried to think of way to get this conversation back on track. 

""Look"" I said ""the religions down there tell us that if we do bad things like murder, steal, rape we go to Hell. Where we are tortured for eternity. If we do good things like go to church/temple/mosque, pray, live by the Bible, the Quran etc we go to heaven to be rewarded.""

The demon shook his head, ""you are speaking nonsense. If you murder, steal, rape than you go to heaven. Where else would you face judgement? The almighty doesn't have time to commute, you go straight to them and they deal with your punishment. That's their whole deal. Obey the laws I laid down or face my wrath. How could bad people face their wrath if you don't go where they are?""

As I processed that mindfuck, he continued ""what do you mean religions? And pretty much every word you said after that?"" 

I look at him, shocked, look around, sure somehow this is all some sort of great cosmic joke. There is nothing to interrupt my views of paradise, or interrupt my thoughts apart from the gentle trill of birdsong off in the distance. I look back him, look into his eyes and seeing genuine confusion. I go on to explain the world's religions to him. 

Many many mojitos later he has taken to just rolling about with laughter. The only words I have had put of him for the last few hours have consisted of ""They said what? People believe that? They do what? Why?""

The topic of sex particularly left with tears streaming down his face in laughter. ""Seriously, come on your pulling my leg? Why would the almighty not want you to enjoy the bodies they created for you? They created you in their images, why would you not enjoy the blessing they gave you? How did anyone convince you all that it was wrong? Jeez you guys can't be doing it right, if you think it's a bad thing"" 

Then of course I have to go on and explain that it's not the act per se but the sin, the shame, the guilt. Both of which are completely foreign concepts to him. 

""Oh man, someone has done a right number on you mortals, you have got some seriously big issues. It does explain a few things though..."" He trails off looking into the distance.

""What?"" I question

""Well"" he says looking a bit embarrassed, ""I only actually the new guy, your my first arrival."" He sees my start at that and hurries on ""It's not that I don't know what I doing, I have done the full 1000 years training, and got top scores for my year. I just didnt get why you humans all seems to go a bit crazy for a bit when you first get here. But it kind of makes sense now.""

""Didn't they tell you any of this?"" I ask

He shakes his head and shugs, ""I would never had believed it if they had. Not sure I do now, hearing it straight from the horse's mouth, it's a lot to take in.""

""Tell me about it!"" I say ""My whole world, no universe view just got totally blown apart.""

He looks sheepish, ""Yeah I guess it's worse for you. But come on sounds like it was all for the best really.""

He stands up and gestures me to follow, ""come on you have the whole of eternity to process that shit. What do you want to do first?""

I smile, ""The Fiery Pits of Hell?""

""What you mean that pool and hot tub?"" I replied "" just looks like people splashing around playing volleyball.""

""I mean it's kinda warm but only in the sunlight those. The shade from those willow trees looks comfy though.""  I said walking over.

The demon chasing after me and exclaimed ""those are geysers of molten lava not weeping willows!""

Before I could reach them the demon ran in front of me and blocked my path.

""Here hold this"" they said while handing me the most beautiful diamond.  Shinning so brilliantly that it seemed to produce the light rather than reflecting it.

""Omg look at this thing."" I said holding it to my eye. "" it's like there is a rainbow inside.""

""WHAT!!! That is a ball of smoldering coal!"" Stamping their foot in disgust.

""Hey dudes look at this"" I yelled walking over to some  people who appeared to be sitting on some picnic tables talking.  

As soon as they saw it I could see wonder in their eyes.""it's beautiful why have I never noticed this before.""

One of the people began crying ""if only I had seen sooner there is so much I could have done around here!!!""

""I know right. when did we get a spa?"" Said a middle aged man wiping what appeared to be soot off his clothes.

""Whoa an angel!""  Exclaimed a child who was using the diamond in a game of catch with some other children.""

""I've never seen one with black feathered wings before.""  A woman carrying an infant said walking up to the demon.  ""I'd like to file some complaints.  Why have we been here so long but not allowed to use these public amenities?""

""What!! There is nothing but pain and suffering here!  Even if we had anything like that it wouldn't be 'Public'.""

""That sign right there by the pool says 'For public use.   For service call (666)555-3146'."" I said. Reading the sign to the demon.

Rubbing their eyes the demon screamed in terror ""oh no I can see them now too!!! What have you done to me!"" Before flapping it's wings and flying away.  

""I'll be back and you'll be sorry!""

""OKAY!"" I yelled back ""Don't forget to bring a supervisor!!!""",177,ph30nix01,2022-12-26 17:00:53

""You must be her father. I see. Where is Anabelle?""

""No, no, I'm the one asking questions. Who the fuck do you think you are?"" I snarled.

The delicate eyebrows of the Moon Goddess furrowed gently. ""That's not an appropriate tone-"" she attempted to chide.

I barked in harsh laughter, interrupting her. ""Like hell it isn't! I have half a mind to smash this thing right now! Only reason I haven't already is because Annie begged me to at least talk to you first. So talk.""

The Moon Goddess sighed and smoothed her far-too-sheer dress. ""I'm glad Moon Warrior Anabelle is well. What did she tell you?""

""She told me enough,"" I said. ""She told me that this gem thing basically turns her into a superhero to fight the, what did she call it?""

""The Shadow that lurks in the hearts of men?"" she offered helpfully.

""Yeah, that. Makes people into monsters. You have my daughter fighting goddamn monsters!"" I shouted. ""What's wrong with you?""

""What's wrong, sir, is that I've been sealed away from the Earth, unable to protect it. People are dying. Your world will fall under the Shadow if nothing is done,"" she said, limpid eyes imploring me.

But I was unmoved. ""One of those people could by Annie,"" I said. ""This is wrong. Why her?""

""Only those with love in their heart, pure and true, could hear my call. Your Anabelle answered. She recognized the threat posed by the shadow. She is a remarkable girl.""

""You have a Moonstone, one of five that I could create. It allows our connection and allows me to transform Anabelle into a Moon Warrior,"" she explained.

""Would it only work on Annie?"" I asked.

The Moon Goddess pondered a moment. ""I suppose not. After all, you can reach me with it. But the user's love must be pure and burn bright, or else the Shadow will defeat you.""

I nodded grimly. ""Believe me, Moon, a father's love definitely burns bright. Annie's not going to fight for you anymore. I'm taking her place as Moon Warrior Dan.

My eyes open wide and I glance to the hallway, where my daughter's kitten steps backward and lets out one big hiss.

""Molly."" I call out hoping to hear my daughter's voice, but instead I hear birds chirping.

""Molly!"" I yell this time.

""Hello."" I hear. She sounds both young and old at the same time, high pitched but somber too. ""I am the Moon Goddess. You must be Molly's mother.""

""I am. Who exactly are you and what have you done with Molly?"" I ask, trying to control my own voice.

""I am the night.""  
""Where's Molly?"" I say again.

""I said, I am the night!"" She exclaims using one hand to point above her. ""I protect against those who use darkness to shield themselves."" 

I roll my eyes. ""Then why is my house glowing pink. Never mind. My DAUGHTER!""

""She has turned fourteen and is now old enough to take her rightful place by my side.""

I stomp my foot. The sound scares the kitten into running down the stairs while yowling.

""Fourteen is not old enough to even roll her eyes without my permission, now bring her back home this instant."" I yell. 

""I am the moon goddess and she is my daughter. She was birthed from my glow and sent to earth until she was ready. . .""  
I cut her off before she can finish. I close the locket, scream and reopen it. The pink light now shimmers making me even angrier.

""She is fourteen. She is my child. I have adoption paperwork and a birth certificate that say so. If she wants to be a moon princess when she's eighteen, she is free to do so then. I think fighting evil should wait until she's graduated college, but that choice will be up to her. Until then, evil is your job.""

""College?"" The moon goddess pauses. ""College?"" She croaks. 

""Education. School. She can study anything from premed to art history."" Please not art history, I think.

""Education? Really? Don't you just have her download the information?"" I hear the cracks in her magical voice.

I shake my head. ""NO! She's a freshman in high school. Teachers give lectures. She reads textbooks, does homework, takes tests and learns the hard way."" 

""She doesn't know how to fight evil?"" The moon goddess asks.

""NO!"" I scream. ""Now send MY daughter back to me right this instant!""

I take a deep breath and the shimmering gets brighter until I have to close my eyes. I feel a touch on my shoulder, and there she stands, just slightly smaller than me, her face tilted upwards. I shake and clutch her. I sob into her hair. Her hair. Her hair is pink. 

""Her hair!"" I yell into the locket.

""Sorry."" The moon goddess is gone. The lights go out and I take one step back to turn the lamp on.",217,ThisWeekNeverEnds,2023-01-11 13:44:34

Easy as that. There’s a goddess on the other line, the kind of woman that you know is unspeakably beautiful just from the sound of her voice. There are no metaphors or similes. Some things simply are.

I look out the kitchen window at my daughter, and I want to be furious.

A few minutes ago I was. She came home bleeding. Lily, my little girl. She’s fourteen, her birthday was in August, and though she’s tall for a girl her age I still remember sweeping her into my arms. Pinning her hair. Teaching her how to tie a ribbon—she loved blue and purple, never pink. Was clear about that, always.

Now bruises peek at me through the cuts in her jeans, and every few seconds she puts a finger to her bloody lip and winces, as shocked that it can still hurt like that.

She hasn’t seen me watching her, yet.

“What are you, really?” I say, whispering to the locket in my palm. I’ve twined the silver chain around my fingers and squeezed it until my fingertips started to lose feeling. The locket is shaped like a full moon, pockmarked, and through the holes—blasted all the way through the moon’s silver skin like bullet holes and exit wounds—I can see that the locket is completely empty. But of course it would be. That’s how this works. Everybody knows.

“Luna,” says the Goddess. “And you?”

“Her mother.”

“Ah.”

Lily came home late tonight, the first time she’s ever done that. Snuck into her bedroom to change her clothes. Rummaged through the fridge. I heard the microwave beeping from the bedroom, where I’d laid awake for hours, waiting. I heard the screen door open, close, and I found this locket by the microwave. Lily was already in the garden by then, a cup of instant ramen tossing steam into the autumn air. It’s midnight, and the full moon tracks across the sky. Clouds pass between them, but somehow Lily is always in its light.

“Is she in danger?” I ask.

“Yes,” the goddess says.

“I should hate you,” I say.

“Why?”

“Because she’s just a girl.”

Laughter, another sound without comparison. “And there’s no danger anywhere in that?”

I sway silently, remembering. Lily finishes her ramen. She leaves the cup in a flower bed we’ve been preparing for the winter. The trees are bare, the wind blows her straw blond hair. She’ll catch a chill, I think.

“Fuck you,” I tell the goddess.

“Shall I retract my gift?”

Lily goes back for the ramen cup, crushes it down, forces it into a pocket. She’s been trying to be more serious about littering. She gazes up at the moon. She shivers. I shiver. I press the locket against my cheek. The metal is shockingly cold, the kind that almost tips you back over into drunken, insensate warmth. In that moment I have power. I want to pull Lily back inside, press a cup of hot tea into her hands, wrap her in a thousand blankets and strap her into bed for the next four years, give or take. I want to introduce her to joys of libraries and church socials. Enroll her in the chess club. Send her to school for something sensible like nursing, or maybe encourage her to indulge her love of children and become a teacher. There’s a path unfolding in front of my eyes where I do exactly that. Protect. She leads a very safe, occasionally pleasant life.

Lily sits down in the grass against a tired elm. A shaggy carpet of fallen leaves surrounds her, and she gathers them to her like a blanket. There have been bags beneath her eyes lately to go with the fresh bruises. I lean forward, and suddenly the glass between us sharpens. Magic. I can see her like we’re only a few feet apart; like I’m not her mother, watching from a distance.

Bloody lips quirk. She smiles.

“She understands?” I ask. “The danger?”

“As much as any little girl could,” the goddess says.

“Alright,” I say. “Just be honest with her. Please.”

""Always,"" the goddess says, and I choose to believe her. Sometimes that's all that we can do.

Time passes. I set the locket by the microwave where I found it. Gather up all the comforters that I can find. It’s October after all, and nights here can be cold.

In the morning Lily wakes beneath a cozy heap of blankets. I have a pot of coffee brewing. Fresh muffins cooling in a tin.

I’ve made dozens of mistakes, if not hundreds. If not thousands.

There was that time when she turned seven and I bought her the purple bike helmet that she wanted, only it was two sizes too small and when we went to exchange it they only had camouflage green ones left. Since I couldn’t be the best dad, I had to be a decent one at least, and I made her wear that helmet anyway. God, she hated me for that. I’ve missed swimming lessons and piano recitals. I’ve fallen asleep when she tried to show me the movies she liked as a kid. 

That’s not to say I didn’t try. I was reaching out, when I could. Trying to find that common ground. Trying to show her, in all the little ways, that I loved her. My wife, her mom.... she passed when Ellie was three. I could’ve been better, I guess, I could’ve been more affectionate, or told her more how much I loved her. How much I cared about her. But words, emotions? Those aren’t my forte. 

Having a kid is a weird thing. Having a teenager, even more so. Where did that smiley little kiddo go? Instead, there was this glum little adult, already taller than her mom was, slamming doors and rolling her eyes and always on that damn phone of hers. Ellie was smart (which she certainly didn’t get from me) and she was great at music and sports and she had such a bright, brilliant future ahead. Why did she shut down? Why the scowling? The dark circles under her eyes? 

Well, at least that all made sense now. This damn *thing* in her room, this stupid locket—it was draining away her childhood. Because, yes, fourteen-year-olds are still children, despite what they might want to believe. 

So that lead me here, in what I can only imagine must be described as a pocket dimension, standing before this floating, glowing entity. The supposed Moon Goddess. Her silver hair floated behind her; beams of white light pierced the rippling darkness. Silky robes billowed around her and moved as if they were made of liquid. 

“This is bullshit.” I held the locket up so she could see it, in case she didn’t know what I meant.

“Eleanor has a great duty to protect your realm from danger,” the goddess replied and, after she spoke, her voices rippled and echoed back on itself. 

“I don’t give a damn! And neither do you.” I pointed my finger at her. Blood rushed through my head and my vision narrowed; anger blacked out the edges of my world. “If you even cared about her in the slightest, you’d know she goes by Ellie.” 

“I have seen things beyond what you can imagine. She is the one for this task. The dark forces—”

“What’s her favourite food? Huh” I crossed my arms. “Her favourite colour? What band has she been saving up for two years to get tickets to? Her best friend?” 

The goddess glared at me. Her expression remained as stoic as ever. “Those petty things do not concern me.” 

“Petty? You think those things are petty?” My anger bubbled into boiling rage. “For everything you claim to know, you don’t understand anything about people. We’re all just stupid little collections of favourite foods and dumb music and shiny little trinkets and people that make us smile!”

The goddess considered me. “And you mean to say the fate of the universe is worth less than—as you said—your daughter’s favourite foods and her dumb music and her shiny trinkets and people that make her smile?” 

“Yes.” I pressed my lips into a line and met her eyes (if they were even her eyes). “Without question.” What universe was there without my daughter?

“Your conviction is admirable,” the goddess said, “but it does not change the reality of this situation. Eleanor is the only one who can stop the dark forces. She has accepted her fate.”

“Well, I don’t.” My heart slammed into my ribs as the idea started to cement in my mind. I lifted my chin. “Give it to me.” 

The goddess actually recoiled in shock; her head pulled back and her glowing eyelids fluttered. “What?”

“Give it to me,” I repeated, enunciating every syllable. 

“You want *me* to make *you*—a 42-year-old welder from Regina—the Moon Princess?”

“Yes.” I locked my jaw. “Do it.”

&#x200B;

“There is no way I’m allowing you to continue to put yourself in these incredibly dangerous situations. I’m not arguing; hand over the locket.” I looked down on my daughter, and took in how much she had changed since obtaining this stupid locket that started all this trouble. While the locket did allow her to grow much more confident and self-assured, which was great as I was thrilled to see her shine, it also brought out a Moon Goddess that took full possession of her and placed her in some comic-book level action and danger. I loved to see the confidence; I didn’t love to see my daughter fighting an enormous lion with an impenetrable hide.    

They really don’t cover these types of situations in any parenting book I’ve been able to find so far.My daughter looked back at me, challenging my request with bright eyes. “Dad, Artemis needs me, and I need her. Do you have any idea how much good I’ve done for the world because of her? She gives me purpose. I’m not giving it to you.”   “Brianna. Hand it over. Now.” I said in as stern of a tone I could muster.   She clasped her hand around the locket around her neck, then she gave a slow smile. “Okay, dad. You can have it.”   

I narrowed my eyes, suddenly very aware of her body language. Something was off, but I wasn’t sure what it was. Teenagers don’t usually just comply without an ulterior motive. Still, I suppose I shouldn’t throw this opportunity away. Who knows when I’ll have another chance to get rid of this thing? I thought to myself.   

She unclasped the locket and pooled it into her palm, then splayed her hand out flat, like presenting a horse with a treat. Eager for me to take it, cautious of what might happen once I grabbed it. I reached out and took the locket from her hand.   

“Thank you. See? Was that so har-” I began, but as I spoke, my body felt like it was ripped from itself. My consciousness being yanked from my physical form. Wind and smoke seemed to whip around me as my surroundings faded into black and began to reform. My feet planted firmly on the soft ground that had materialized seemingly from nothing.    

The scent of damp foliage, soil, and petrichor filled my nose. I heard a breeze gently blowing through the leaves and a choir of crickets softly sang in the background. My eyes began to focus on the environment I was suddenly in. I stood at the edge of a small pond, the water glistening silver in the moonlight. A deer stood at the edge of the pond, staring intently at me.   

 I was frozen. What just happened? Where was I? How did I get here? Then it dawned on me. The locket. I touched the locket and now I was in the Moon Goddess’s domain. You know what? Fine. I’d love to have a word with her anyway. Maybe I can talk some sense into her and explain that my daughter is not an appropriate vessel for her purpose.    

The deer began to approach me with an unnerving sense of confidence. As it walked closer, a silver mist began to engulf the creature until it was no longer visible. As the mist began to clear, the deer had disappeared and a new form had materialized.    “So you must be the Moon Goddess responsible for stealing my daughter’s childhood.” I said coldly. As Artemis stood in front of me I wasn’t scared. I knew that I stood no chance against her in any capacity so if she was going to kill me, at least she could hear what I really thought of her.   

 “Yes, I am Artemis; goddess of the hunt and the moon.” She replied.     

Despite being one of the most powerful heroes on the planet, she was truly a sight to behold. She towered over me; her hair hung in a loose ponytail, bound with a vine and a simple golden laurel crown. She was beautiful and cruel; truly balanced. She wore a tunic made of leather and a skirt. She had leather braces on her arms and legs and a belt equipped with several severe looking daggers. A beautiful ebony bow with intricate carvings along the shaft, along with black fletched arrows was strung across her back.   

 “I have seen you many times, through Brianna’s eyes. I brought you here to tell you that I will not dissolve our contract. She and I are bound together. Through her I have the strength to fight for the women of this world and through me she has the strength to live without fear,” Artemis looked down at me.   

My voice caught in my throat as I choked back tears. “Please, she’s only a child. If you really were a protector of women, you would know that it is because of you that her life is constantly in danger. I can’t allow you to do this to her...” I said, through labored breath. I wasn’t scared of Artemis, but I was scared of losing Brianna.   

“Please,” I pleaded. “She’s my little girl. I can’t let anything happen to her. Please...”    

Artemis made no movement towards me as I gently wept. “If you know anything about me, you will know that I never let any harm befall my hunters provided they maintain their promise to me. As long as she remains untainted by men she is safe. However, your emotions have moved me enough to show you what I can do for her.”    

We walked to the edge of the pond and she pointed to the still water. The surface of the pond began to ripple and an image began to form. This was one of the battles that Artemis and Brianna had fought together as a team.    

I saw Brianna, but never as I had seen her before. She had completely embodied the essence of Artemis. The same ebony bow in her hands as she skillfully knocked a black fletched bow. She drew back the arrow and let it fly. As the arrow bolted from her grip, it shined gold and split into twenty more arrows. Each one singing as it hurtled towards its target. The arrows hit the titan with ear shattering force, carving out enormous chunks of its flesh.    

With uncanny speed, she sprinted closer to the monster and drew a wicked looking dagger in each hand. As she enclosed on the beast, she shot between its legs and sliced both tendons around its ankles, bringing the titan to its knees. She took her opportunity for her finishing blow. Leaping out in front of the beast, again, she knocked another arrow. But instead of point it directly at the titan, instead she pointed straight up into the air. She screamed something I couldn’t understand as she prepared to unleash her final attack.    

Just before she released her arrow, the titan clapped two enormous hands around her. The force of the grab surely would have crushed a train, there was no chance she came out of this unscathed.    

I turned to Artemis to tell her that this was exactly the kind of danger I was talking about when she waved her hand to silence me and pointed back to the water. I looked back down to see the titan with its hands still collapsed together; suddenly black light began to escape through the gaps in its grip. The light shined brighter and brighter, pulsing with unfathomable energy. The titan’s grip broke as Brianna exploded from her containment.     

The distracted titan did not realize that Brianna had once again primed her final attack. Bow and arrow poised high into the sky, she released the arrow. I thought maybe the arrows would multiply again, but instead it disappeared into the atmosphere. Terrified, I looked back at Brianna who had a smug look on her face.      

Just as I was questioning her actions, I heard a crack of energy. I looked back up at the sky and a bolt of pure moonlight, crackling with power came down from the heavens. The attack rang true and decimated the titan, striking with lethal energy. The titan lie unmoving; defeated.   

 The image on the pond began to fade and I turned to Artemis.  

 “Are you satisfied that your daughter is safe in my care? As long as she abides by the rules set for my hunters, she is safe. If she strays from the rules, then I will dismiss her and find a new vessel. But no man will ever command me, regardless of who he is.” she said.     I sighed. This was obviously not an argument I was going to win. So, in my experience, best to at least get something out of a compromise.     

 “It seems like I don’t have a choice. But I’m setting a curfew. No deadly activities after midnight. Deal? Please?” I said.

I was standing by the window, waiting for my guest to arrive. Naomi was passed out in her bed with an ice pack over her black eye. And I had some choice words for the person responsible.

The moonlight shined through the window at last. A woman faded into existence, her hair and dress stark white. The moon goddess turned to me and smiled. ""Greetings, Delilah Isadora--'

*SMACK!*

I cut off the Goddess's spiel with a slap and hissed at her, ""Save it. I am not in the goddamn mood.""

The Goddess rested a hand on her bruised cheek and winced. ""It seems I misjudged the exact level of animosity you have for me.""

""Well, judgement isn't exactly your strong suit. Can't think of any other reason you'd decide to trust a *fourteen year old* to fight monsters and supervillains!""

The Goddess glared at me. ""Ms. Isadora, I don't think you fully grasp the situation--""

""Grasp what situation?! That some primordial bitch handed my daughter a magic locket and told her to go fight a bunch of superpowered lunatics and demons, not giving a damn about how her grades, social life, and interpersonal relationships might suffer?!""

The Goddess grabbed me by the collar and yelled, ""SHE'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT!""

The Goddess's outburst hung in the air like a miasma. As she let go of me and sunk to the floor, the Goddess wearily said, ""I had thirty-eight other potential recipients for the Lunar Locket. I visited each one of them in disguise, so that I might vet their character. Your daughter passed the test, but...she was too young. I had to rule her out.""

""Then why didn't you choose one of the other--"" I stopped when I saw the Goddess's pained expression. ""Oh God.""

The Goddess began to choke up. ""The longest any of the other girls lasted was two days after my test. Someone found them and killed them. Your daughter is the last one standing, and if I had any other option, she would not have the Locket.""

I sighed deeply and sat down next to her. ""Does Naomi know?""

The Goddess shook her head. ""I can't bring myself to tell her. But she's going to find out eventually. I just... I just want to protect her.""

""How about that? We've got some common ground after all.""

The Goddess chuckled weakly as I looked at her and said, ""I'm still pissed at you for your decision, but... I can at least respect it. Just promise me you'll tell Naomi the truth, okay? She deserves to know.""

The Goddess nodded as she stood up and began to turn into moonlight. ""Farewell, Delilah Isadora. May your nights be naught but peaceful.""

Once the Goddess left, I quietly entered Naomi's room. I kneeled beside her, rested my hand on her head, and kissed her on the cheek. ""My little superhero.""",123,jardanovic,2023-01-11 12:24:06

""Sorry, who are-,""  
   
""AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!"" Carrie screamed. She had been about to give the so-called 'Moon Goddess' a piece of her mind when a black hole suddenly appeared in her daughter's bedroom. A pale, teenage girl with rainbow hair wearing a crisp white suit walked out of the portal and surprised Carrie. She recovered quickly as she recognized the teenager. And, she even took a step forward to both get a closer look and show the stranger she wasn't scared. ""You??"" Carrie asked as her mind offered up the teen's name. ""You're Monday, right?""  
   
""Oh, hey,"" the teen nodded at her in recognition. ""That's me; you were looking for a gift for your daughter, right? Carrie, was it?""  
   
""You're the Moon Goddess??"" Her mind was trying to make sense of the situation. It couldn't have been a coincidence that she meet the teen around the same time the Moon Princess started saving people. Another hero in the news wasn't particularly noteworthy. Although, Carrie couldn't help but notice how enthusiastic her daughter was when it came to the Moon Princess' exploits. She was the girl's mother and her daughter wasn't especially devious; it was easy to see the connection.  
   
""Yeah,"" Monday giggled and nodded. ""Your daughter decided that was my title, so sure. I don't mind.""  
   
""When did you meet my daughter? WHY??"" Carrie took two steps closer to the door. She found the teen selling knickknacks out of a backpack in the mall. She initially thought Monday was working some sort of charity selling chocolates or pens and she wanted to take a look. Instead of letting her dig through the bag, she just asked what Carrie was looking for. After revealing her daughter's upcoming 14th birthday, Monday said she had the perfect gift. She reached into the backpack and pulled out a transparent glass card. After a brief demonstration, Carrie was convinced it was better than the latest and greatest smartphones, and cheaper too. At the time, Carrie thought she'd never see Monday again. Now, she was realizing that the phone was probably part of a larger scam.  
   
""I helped her set up the node you bought,"" she said.  
   
""You're the reason she's out there!"" Carrie wasn't going to let herself get distracted from why she called. She didn't even do any snooping. She wandered into her daughter's bedroom to drop off laundry and the Moon Princess locket sat on the desk in plain sight. The golden crescent moon lined with pink gemstones was distinctive enough for Carrie to recognize. Her daughter couldn't help but point it out every time it was on the news; and somehow, the news in her house was always talking about the Moon Princess.   
   
Carrie felt like her daughter would have showed her if she got a replica, the girl regularly showed off her cosplay gear. And, as she had that thought, she realized her daughter had been spending more time out in the evenings instead of working on her hobby. She grabbed the locket from the desk and it felt real and heavy. She tugged at it and the crescent moon opened with the hinges at the tips. Once it was opened it looked like a golden full moon with legible text floating in the empty center. She saw an entry that said: ""Moon Goddess"" and pressed it.  
   
She didn't know who it was at the time; but, as soon as Monday answered, she went off on the stranger for putting her daughter at risk. Instead of listening to the abuse, Monday Traversed to see who was angry and why.  
   
""I mean, technically, you're the reason she's out there,"" Monday shrugged. ""The important thing is she's having fun and enjoying her gift, right?""  
   
""What??"" Carrie tilted her head at Monday. ""You think I wanted this life for my daughter??""  
   
""What?"" Monday mirrored Carrie's response; but, she was genuinely confused. ""No, that's a weird assumption. How would you know what your daughter wants? Your gift let her choose exactly what she wanted.""  
   
""She wanted this??"" Carrie asked. ""Why? Why is she putting her life in danger?""  
   
""Who's in danger?"" Monday asked.  
   
""MY DAUGHTER!"" Carrie shouted. ""Every night! She goes out and fights evil! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SEND KIDS????""  
   
""Ohhh,"" Monday chuckled. ""Yeah, no. It's not real,"" Monday said. A look of confusion took over Carrie's face and remained there as she stared at Monday. Luckily, the teen kept talking. ""Okay, let me back up,"" she said. She raised her hand in the air with the palm facing Carrie. Her hand was empty until it wasn't. Carrie watched it happened, but she couldn't explain how Monday plucked a transparent glass card out of literal thin air.  
   
""This is a node, like the one you bought,"" Monday said. ""They're made from nanos and can look like anything. Most people think it's convenient if they look like nothing,""  Monday pushed the card forward into the air. It disappeared completely as she pushed it into nothing. ""But, some people like to get creative,"" she added. Monday plucked the node out of the air again. She held it out on her palm and Carrie watched it disintegrate into white powder before it change shape into another Moon Princess locket.  
   
""Nodes...,"" Monday nodded at the locket to drive the point home. ""...have a lot of functions. But, the most important one is AlterNet Access. The AlterNet is a life-sized game that takes place across alternate universes networked together. Your daughter made an AlterNet character and she's playing the game. There's a good chance the villains she's fighting are other players too,"" Monday added.  
   
""Just 'a good chance'?"" Carrie asked. Monday had given her too much information to try and reason through then and there. And, she could actually talk to her daughter later now that it sounded like the situation wasn't as dire as she thought. She'd mentioned alternate universes; but, there was still a chance her daughter was in danger in this one. That was her priority. ""What if there are Supervillains that aren't playing the game?""  
   
""Oh, that's not possible,"" Monday shook her head.  
   
""But, you just said there's 'a good chance' they're other players. What  about the ones that aren't?""  
   
""If they're not players, they're known as NPCs,"" Monday said. That was a term that Carrie had heard often enough from her daughter to kind of know what it meant. It was actually a little bit disturbing to hear that NPCs existed even in reality. But, given everything else Monday had proven, she was willing to accept the statement. ""The thing about the AlterNet is Players know they're in a game. NPCs just go about their business and stick to the system. They're going about it in different ways; but, EVERYONE is playing the game.""

He spoke firmly and confidently into the dark of his bedroom, hand clasped tightly around...something, just under his bed frame. “I can’t very well look you in the eyes if I can’t see you, friend.” 

“Not a man,” said a quiet voice, muffled behind the bedskirt. “Not a friend,” it said louder. 

Tyler tightened his grasp. “That’s my fault, friend,” said Tyler, ever cool in awkward social settings. “I should not have misgendered you. You see, my father was old school, and I should probably modify his sayings for the modern age.” 

“Not a friend,” said the voice again. 

“Well, I’d hate to break it to you, friend,” said Tyler jovially, “but where I come from—which just so happens to be here—a handshake that lasts this long is called holding hands. And if we ain’t friends holding hands, then we must be lovers.” 

“Lovers?” Said the voice noticeably caught off guard. 

Tyler’s father had taught him many things in life. The handshake thing, sure. Something about never trusting a fart after Tijuana Tuesday—another truism Tyler would need to modernize. But one of the most important things Tyler’s father had taught him was this: 

If you’re caught in a bad situation, always be the craziest one in the room—no one wants to mess with crazy.

“You heard right,” said Tyler quietly. “We must be lovers. You’re already in my bedroom, you’re holding my hand, what’s next, my sweet underbed lurker? What will we do with all this pent up...energy?” Tyler extended his index finger and began to lightly stroke whatever it was that he was holding. 

Tyler heard muffled grunts as the being struggled to release itself from his grip.  “Stop! Stop!” Shouted the voice. “Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?” 

Tyler held strong. “Dude? What a cute pet name for me. I think I’ll call you honey!” Tyler crooned. “Come on up, honey! Let’s see what kind of trouble we can get into.” 

Tyler felt the being below him thrash about under his bed, it’s body slammed against the underside of his box spring and rang loudly throughout the quiet house. “Seriously, dude. Let me go!” Said the voice. “I promise, I’ll leave, just let me go.” The voice sounded scared. Desperate. 

Now it was Tyler’s chance to put to practice another of his father’s wise words: 

If you ain’t gonna eat it, let it go quick. 

“I always was more of a catch and release fisherman,” Tyler said. “You be good now, though. I don’t want to hear about you holding hands with other lovers around town, honey. I’m a jealous man,” Tyler said.

He loosened his grip and let go. Tyler heard the sound of claws against his hardwood floor as whatever it was scurried away as fast as it could. 

Tyler fell quickly back to sleep, unfazed by his impromptu midnight hand holding session. 

Shortly after falling back to sleep he felt a pressure on his chest. He opened his eyes to see his sleep paralysis demon staring back at him. 

“Hey there good-lookin,” he said cheerfully. 

“Don’t you ‘good-lookin’ me!” Said the Demon. “What the fuck was all that ‘honey’ shit earlier? You thought I wouldn’t see that?” 

Tyler exhaled loudly. Another truism of his father’s: 

Try as you might, you can’t out crazy crazy.

A quest draws a hero to a villain? An unanswerable question drives one to an unimaginable terror?

Rumelda Stimple had lost a half dozen customers to the bedroom. I'd only heard about it in passing. She keeps a low profile, and when you enter her inn you wouldn't know she was its owner. But I found it, and I was lucky enough to draw the room, the very same that had caused wars to be fought, that had broken truces, treaties, and caused unimaginable pain.

If I hadn't heard the rumors of the King's rise to power out of nowhere from a monk on East Island of the seven kingdoms then I wouldn't have known to look in the Green Forest. And if I didn't recognize mushroom traps and spore signaling then I would have thought this to be a place filled with mysterious magic and it would have overwhelmed me.

But Rumelda has built a sham around this place. A deal with the devil, and the devil pays well. If she can draw in the right people she'll thrive off of the devil's investments, and if she draws in the wrong people, well, hopefully they didn't have a family.

I was not going to be the wrong man, not today. Not this year, the year of my only daughter's birth. When I shook his hand I could feel the spores of the contract seared into my being, but I did not come unarmed.

With the devil's hand in mine I cast three spells. The first was a binding spell, to allow the handshake to play out without any funny business. If he won the shake, then it would be fair play. The second was something I'd learned last time I was in the Green. The forest offers lessons to any adventurer brave enough to train against its strange conjurings. I found that some beings are best fought in the light, and my second spell allowed me the strength to pull him from his chamber under the bed if I so desired.

The third spell would be my undoing one way or another. If it worked, I would secure my daughter's future, and gain contract with the devil. I would become a family man and lose my adventuring. If it failed, he would see me for the sham I was and attempt to take me under.

""OW!"" screamed the devil. ""That's quite painful.""

I could hear wincing and sighing as he tried to let go and take back his hand. I ripped him out from his chamber.

The devil laid on the ground, hand still in mine. He was three feet tall and his darkness was fading until his true form became real. He was no devil at all. He was only one of the forest creatures, no doubt hungry from lack of adventurers as of late.

""Pity,"" I said to him. ""I thought we were going to go places together. No matter..."" I trailed off as I reached my hand into my pocket and grabbed a slip of paper. I wrote a few words, a few clauses and justifications. A few calculations and I arrived at a number.

""For your position, and my associated terms.""

I handed him the slip, and he put on a monocle and perused the terms.

""You want my estate? And you would be my employer?"" His dark aura emerged out of nothing and began to shroud around him once more, slowly pulling him back under.

""I was prepared for things to go differently, but at this juncture, I think this is appropriate. You've no doubt served a number of terms here. And from what I understand after this ad hoc introduction, you are not the first to reside here. And you seem unfit for the position. No offense. Just my professional opinion.""

He was furious. Before he could return to the under and gain back his power I activated the magic in the third spell. I'd bought it off of a wandering ex-monk who'd abandoned East Island. He'd told me the spell was only as strong as my firmest handshake.

I used the third spell to maintain the handshake through anything. Three times the creature tried to return back to below, but found his hand in mine each time. On the fourth time I knew the magic worked. His hand departed from his arm. I took the contract and dribbled a few drops of blood down onto the hand's finger, and pressed the print. Then I released the hand, and the shake was done with.

His hand returned to below, and I knew that the magic had succeeded.

Unfortunately, the terms I wrote gave him weekends off, and indicated that he wouldn't start until the following morning. But then it was that he set off in search of my daughter, to bring her back to me. Until then, there would be a new devil under the bed.",80,ANakedCowboy,2023-02-25 15:13:14

Something slimy touched my hand. On reaction, I immediately clutched it, and shook firmly.

""You're late, Isaac.""

""Sorry, Azazel. I got caught up in some... business.""

Business didn't really cut it, but I was willing to lie this time. Azazel grunted and she climbed out from under the bed before turning the lights on. Her visage was difficult to comprehend, as expected, but to me, she took the form of an amorphous slime creature, dripping yet strangely clean.

The interview had now begun. Rather than ask me questions about myself, she vomited out some documents for me to go over. It was all employee reports — fabricated, of course — and I was to review their performance and recommend promotions stern talking-tos.

It took a span of 30 minutes to fill them all out. I felt Azazel's gaze on my back, but I didn't feel threatened. It was in the contract that we were not to harm each other. Demons needed human employees to handle things they couldn't, and paperwork was one of them.

I handed the documents back to Azazel, who promptly ate them. ""We'll contact you in two weeks!"" she stated, with a clearly fake cheer, before slithering under my bed and disappearing.",25,DragonEyeNinja,2023-02-25 20:03:38

Through the haze of waking up, it hit me that there really was a stranger underneath me gripping my hand. ""Who are you?"" I said groggily, keeping my hand firmly entrenched in his.

""It doesn't matter who I am, only that I'm here. It's a rather special occasion!"" His high-pitched tone reflected a bizarre glee that served to terrify me even further.

""Some creepy dude being under my bed isn't what I'd call special!"" I reached for my phone on the nightstand with my other hand, thinking of a way that I could dial 9-1-1 without cluing him in.

""Erm. That phone won't be necessary,"" he said.

""Wait? How.."" I stuttered, looking around to see if somehow he could see me.

When he said nothing, I continued to reach for the phone. Every time I tried to put my fingers around it, I somehow misjudged the grip and it slipped away.

""There' is a bit of a problem,"" he finally said with a sigh. ""In this place you are and you aren't."" He gripped my hand harder, then made to let go.

I refused, shuddering. His bizarre statement didn't register.

Then he spoke with sadness in his voice. ""You poor creature! It's easier once you let go and give in. You know what? I'll tell you how.""

I gripped his hand even harder now. I wasn't about to let him get away from me. I lunged over for the phone again, missing it. *Damn.* ""I'm not going anywhere!""

""It's a lot easier when you stop fighting. The first thing is to just let go of my hand. Second thing is to roll off the bed so you're down here with me.""

""No!"" I looked over towards my phone again. I noticed something that looked like headlights through the window.

""You're not going to get away from me,"" he said. ""I don't show up for missed opportunities.""

""NO!"" I screamed aloud. I could hear the thump-thump-thump of my heartbeat getting louder. The room started to spin. I didn't let go of his hand.

Light flooded the room, but I couldn't see anything through the haze.

The hand started to pull me even harder. I dug my other elbow into the bed to anchor myself. My heart was going thump thump thump thump thump-ker-thump-ker-thump-ker-thump.

""I will not fail!"" the voice said even louder.

When I looked towards our grasped hands I saw that his wasn't a hand at all, but rather a large tentacle with weird fingers at the end. Slime ran in gloops from the top to the bottom, running over my fingers. I grabbed even harder.

Shapes appeared in the haze. I could hear muffled voices, but couldn't make out what they were saying. I could've sworn someone was screaming. The tentacle grabbed even harder, and the voice moaned with exhaustion.

""Come.... come... come.... it's time. Do not make a fool of me!""

Shocks began to crash over my body, jolting away the haze one by one.

The next moment I opened my eyes.

""CORY!"" my girlfriend screamed.

“How strange you are not scared rather you say hello! Hahahaha!” It roared “I am the fallen one. The one who tried to be better then the creator. You are interesting!”

I sit up slowly. He rises from the darkness slower. I was letting my eyes adjust, and dare not stand incase I offend him. From his description I knew this was the devil himself, but I had never expected him to be so nice and calm. From stories I expected something scarier. 

“May I sit Ever.” 

“Please, sorry i don’t have a proper place for you to sit .” 

“It’s alright I’m the one that barged in.” 

“Ahhh yes umm why did you come to me out of no where?” 

“Ever I do not know my father called for me and you. I know you must be confused, but let me just tell you this have an open mind we changed humanities history long ago. Please do not assume anything.” 

“Thank you for the warning. Sorry if I offends I’m not the most well versed in biblical or religious ... things. Also could you please turn on the lights?” 

“Of course.”

He walked over to the light switch. I thought it a little funny this person who has lived millions ... no billions of years would walk to turn on the lights for me. As the lights go on I am amazed. I see a person so beautiful I could almost call it love at first sight. My eyes could not look away. I regain myself and look around and see something I can’t put my finger on it but I see it next to Lucifer. 

“What is that next to you” I ask 

“W-what. You can see father” 

“That is god? I can’t say that I see him more like I see something I can’t put my finger on.”

“Hahahahahaha. This child does not disappoint.” God said with a calm voice “I haven’t made a new angel in a long time. Thankfully you are a good child like all the rest.” 

“What?!” Lucifer and I shout

“Hahahaha” god was amused by our confusion 

My mind ran wild with questions. Suddenly, my thoughts quiet down. I look at god as he starts to become more clear. I see a man with long hair curly hair both black and white all over. A clean shaven face with an expression of love. 

“You are my newest child. Let me explain chi...”

“Wait father what do you mean he is an angel?” Lucifer interrupted “This man is our new brother? When did you do this? Why did you do this? What ... I-I don’t understand.” 

“Lucifer do you think a man would be able to see me? This child wii be the one that helps you all with everything. Let me give him his memories back.”

My head felt like it was eating something, but it was the sense of memories being given back. I knew my roel in this world. We angels do not grow exactly we are born the way we are. I remember conversations with father as he hid me from the others. The reason he hid me was to nurture me to be like him loving, calm, wise, and most importantly literally a part of him. I look at him as I realize that he is me and I am him. He puts his finger on his lips with a smile. 

“Hahahahahah. Ok I understand why don’t you go rest for now I’ll be there in a second.” 

God left us. Lucifer looked perplexed at me. Probably thinking “how could this new born talk so casually to father?” But that was only ... a feeling. 

“So you are our new brother?”

“ Yes I am. I’ll be helping everyone out. Also I’m sorry for the role that you have been given as the fallen one. I know it’s not true but I am still saddened that the humans think of you in that way.”

“We tried raising them without consequences, but they would not be scared because there wasn’t a punishment, so father asked me to be their enemy. I thought it was a punishment but after a while I saw how the humans changed. I knew father was right.”

“Can you get the others for me please. I would like to talk to them all, and I’m sure father would want to as well.”  

“Yes! I’ll go and get everyone.” 

I went to gods room as he rests there. I knew that he was about to sleep for a long time. When go sleeps anything is possible. We Angeles protect everything from true evil. Things the human do not know, or at least we hoped they didn’t. I am known to the others as an angel but I am more like a new god. They don’t have to know neither does the enemy. This war will be long and hard as it has been for the last millions of years. Now it is my time to fight my time to protect.",8,Chemical-Check7903,2023-02-25 17:56:53

""It's doesn't mean anything. It's just fiction."" 

""Based heavily on your actual life,"" I spat, tossing several shirts into my luggage. ""And you and I both know that's bullshit because if it was just fiction, you would've shown me the real pages you wrote. Instead of just stroking my ego to keep me quiet."" 

I'd been so proud of him when he'd gotten the book deal. I knew how many years he'd spent trying to make it as a writer, all the novels he'd left unfinished, all the rejection letters he'd got. I'd comforted him after every single one. Until finally an offer letter. 

When I asked to read the book, he hesitated. It went over my head then, the way his eyes flooded with fear when I asked to read a couple pages. I just thought he was heady with champagne. He e-mailed them to me a few days later. Truthfully I was impressed but surprised the publishers had gone for it. His writing was beautiful, it always was. The characters were pulled straight from life. He might've changed a few names but clear as day I recognized his mother, his friends, his brothers. Even me. He'd included bits and pieces of our story, only the good parts which I was grateful for, even though deep down I felt it left the book without much conflict. 

Little did I know, I'd only gotten the friends and family version. 

 ""Did you really think, I wouldn't find out? That no one would find out?"" I yelled. ""That I am so easily appeased and illiterate that I wouldn't buy my own fiance's book?"" 

He sighed, ashamed. ""I... didn't think it would matter."" 

I scoffed. ""You didn't think it would matter that you tore me shreds in your book?"" 

""I changed the names!"" he desperately reminded me. ""It's not like anyone knows that it's you!"" 

""EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT'S ME!"" I roared. ""WHO ELSE IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE?!"" 

I'd picked up a copy of the book yesterday, practically giddy when I saw it displayed front and center at our favorite bookstore. That giddiness turned to horror when I actually started reading it. He'd written about everything. Every single detail I shared with him in confidence. My parents, my depression, my mistakes... my assault. Raw and exaggerated, it was all out there for everyone to see. 

And, see they did. Suddenly all the hushed whispers and side glances I'd been getting at work and from friends made sense. 

He begged me to stay but I refused. I couldn't spend another night in the apartment, looking at his face. If I could've fit the last three years in the suitcase and taken it with me, I would've. I settled for a couple of outfits, some shoes and what was left of my dignity. 

As I stood in the elevator waiting for it descend to the ground floor, I ruminated on all the times he'd kissed me on the forehead and called me his muse. 

I used to think it was a compliment.",796,tsh87,2022-11-29 10:40:10

Miranda liked the title, and that was the extend of it. The story itself was lackluster, fantasy aficionados wouldn't find much novelty, those looking to be afraid would miss the shiver down their spines.

That was for the literary criticism. Daniel was also her boyfriend, and he managed to become a published author, which in itself was a feat far beyond her personal appreciation of his book.

This, and more, she thought as she picked up the book to buy it from the store. The pile was rather low, she wasn't the first to buy, despite Daniel having no real reputation as writer to speak of.

""If I may, tell your boyfriend I adore his work,"" said the clerk, a young, somewhat sheepish looking man.

""Of course,"" she replied.

A few steps from the exit, she turned back and added, ""how do you know my boyfriend wrote it?""

""I'm friends with him.""

Odd. Daniel had never told her about him. Nor did she like the glint in his eyes. She left the store, forgetting the strange encounter once outside.

How long had it been since last time she sat on a bench to read a book? She couldn't remember. She decided to celebrate by rekindling this old habit. She found a lone bench in a park, sat down, well protected from the cold in her heavy coat. She smelled the book, just like new, and opened the first page.

She turned page after page. And didn't remember a thing.

Yet she had read several drafts, had encouraged Daniel to go for a bolder opening, had an idea of the general themes. So where was the story about adventure and polymorphism? Where were the sentences and style she knew  to dislike?

Instead, the words flew in an alien way, she felt them worm their way under her eyes, and when she closed the book to gaze at the sky above, she still sensed how the words burrowed through her.

It was unpleasant, and incomprehensible. There was no story, she wasn't sure what she had read, only that it had an impact on her.

Passerby nodded at her, with a smile she could only describe as perfectly fake.

""Wonderful book, is it not?"" said an elder woman walking with a crutch. In her bag, a copy from *House of Change*.

For a moment, all motion stopped in the park. Walkers and runners stood in place, gazing straight at Miranda, sporting the exact same wrong smile, carrying their copy of Daniel's book.

She rubbed her eyes. When she opened them again, movement had resumed, as if nothing had happened.

She was sick, had to be.

Against her better judgement, she opened the book again.

The words slipped down her spine, tickled her ribs, swelled her heart. The words played in her flesh like a mad spark ready to create chaos, and through the chaos, make her anew.

A gasp, someone stripped the book from her hands. She had stopped breathing, nearly passed out.

""Don't read too much into it,"" said the voice of the man who had taken the book.

She looked up.

""Daniel?""

No noise, no motion. They were all looking at them, without a smile, but with that glint in their eyes.

""What is this?"" she asked with a trembling voice.

""It isn't a story,"" Daniel explained, ""it's more of a guide. As a human you are both sculptor and sculpture, but I never liked the rudimentary ways we have to practice our art. So I devised... new methods.""

Miranda would have told him to knock it off already. But the words still squirmed underneath her skin, eager to break free.

A young boy approached them. As he walked, his shadow distended, the audible crack of breaking bone was heard. His legs got longer with each step, muscles tearing to accommodate the new architecture, spine creaking, pulling on the nerves.

""Oh god,"" she whispered, as the looming child's frame hid the sun from her.

She passed out.

When she awoke, she was in bed.

What a nightmare it had been. What pleasure it was to wake up under a warm blanket, secure and cozy.

Miranda rubbed her eyes, gasped when she saw *House of Change* on the nightstand.

With a trembling hand, she reached for the book.

""Not you,"" said Daniel as he put his own hand on the book to keep it closed.

""Why not?""

""I don't want you to change.""

Miranda shook her head, was about to scream, kept it in through sheer willpower.

""Enough. It's a bad joke. I'm just sick, that's all.""

""You're not sick.""

""I said enough,"" it was both an order and a plea.

Daniel sighed, and rose. She heard the already familiar crack, saw the bone splinters poke through the flesh and clothes, dragged the blanket to her as a feeble attempt to protect herself as a new set of bloody, spidery limbs protruded from Daniel's torn back.

There he stood, still, smiling, bloody, and bloodily happy.

Out of wits, Miranda asked:

""Why don't you want me to change?""

""Few things are precious enough to be kept as they are. You are one of them.""

Daniel left the room with his book.",2076,Ataraxidermist,2022-11-29 07:18:15

I have to double check the cover a few times to make absolutely sure that I picked up the right book? Could this really be the right book? The draft that I read was a self-help book about how to organize your life and find inner peace through organization. It didn't have any mention of any dragons. And it certainly didn't have any male dragon on male dragon erotica.

I start thinking about what this could mean. Is this her way of saying that she is unsatisfied? Does she want me to dress like a dragon? If she does would I be willing to do it? I don't know, I guess I could.... Sounds like a hell of a costume. Where do I even go for such a thing.

Maybe I am overthinking it. Maybe she doesn't want me to dress up at all. Maybe it is something else. I remember how vividly she described the dragons. How they had length and girth and veins. The monstrosity and power of the size. You know what, never mind. I'm gonna go with that she wants me to dress up as a dragon. Final answer. That is definitely it and nobody is going to change my mind. And if anyone even whispers ""male fragility"" I swear I will go slap city on you.

Sighing, I realize that the truth is I am just going to have to talk to her. Why would she hide this from me? Why is this a completely different book from what she said she was writing? And why did the one dragon breathe fire up the other dragon's bunghole?

I hear the garage and know that she has arrived.

I approached her with a smile and held the book up signaling that I bought it.

She smiles back but questions why I bought it when I've already read it at home.

I tell her the final draft was significantly different from the version I read.

She tells me the editor probably made a few final edits.

I tell her that she should try opening it up if she hasn't already.

And she does. At first there was confusion. Then shock. Then anger.

She is on the phone with her editor, her publicist, her agent. She is yelling about the smut that ended up in her book. There is confusion all around. Nobody knows how it happened.

He’d been working on it for more than two years, while I paid the bills, and when he’d sent it away to a big publisher, the arrival of a massive, £50,000 advance cheque had been amazing.

Bill had done most of the work, but I’d done my bit: it was one of our rituals to read a few pages together, every Sunday afternoon and discuss the character, plot, and future developments. Bill preferred it that way. I left him alone for the rest of the week as he said he could concentrate better that way. In a little office he rented. No distraction. 

I’d been looking forward to getting my hands on the first copy and I’d been queuing since 8 a.m., waiting for the shop to open. Bill was going to be so surprised when he got home tonight. I have to say, I was very surprised that the publisher didn’t give him an advance copy , if only to proof read it, but what do I know about publishing? Maybe they do it all by email these days? Well they’re paying, so I guess they get to call the shots.

There’d been a big publicity campaign, telling people how good the novel is. Transformational, one called it. Bill’s been giving interviews and telling people how it’s all based on his own life experiences. There’s been so much hype that the queue to buy it snaked round the block. I’m so proud...

My heart skipped a beat as the bookshop staff unlocked the door and the crowd surged forward, which caught me by surprise. They’re so keen! Still, I’d made sure I was near the head of the queue. I had to get a copy today! Bill’s first published novel!

At twenty quid, it wasn’t cheap, but it’s all money in Bill’s pocket, and from the way the crowd were buying the copies, they would be sold out soon! 

I hugged my precious copy to my chest and made my way to the checkout. 

“I’ve heard it’s brilliant!!” The cashier was bubbling with enthusiasm. “Best erotic fantasy since Fifty Shades! Better, even!”

“Erotic fantasy? But I thought it was a mystery novel...”

“Oh no. It’s about a bored husband who manages to sleep with every woman under the age of 70 in his entire street! He tells his wife he’s writing a novel, but sets up a shag-pad and gets to it...

I didn’t need an imagination to know what “it” was.

I put the book back on the shelf. No point in letting Bill know that I knew. I dare say I’ll be able to pick up a copy in a few months as evidence in the divorce courts. I can wait.

When Angela told me she had managed to get a publishing deal for the book she wrote and I helped edit, I was ecstatic for her. She had managed to achieve her dream, after all. 

But this was... Well, it was crap. Nothing like what she wrote in the first place. I felt bad for her now, money or no money. It sure feels hollow when dreams are fulfilled in seemingly the worst way possible...

It was as if someone took her story, removed all evidence of good writing, then turned it into yet another vapid teen romance book about a vampire! The characters were renamed, story aspects that made it make sense before were removed and replaced nonsense, and many dialogs were edited heavily in a way that made the characters seem more juvenile... The only part that stayed true to form was the sex scenes, bizarrely, though they lacked the previous immaculate romantic context.

""This fucking sucks"" I said to myself, finishing the first few chapters while sitting in the bookstore parking lot. ""I hope Angie isn't too disappointed""

When I got home, I thought about how to ask her delicately about the travesty that was her book, but it seems my brain got ahead of me before I could think it through all the way.

 ""Honey, why is your book trashier than a dumpster fire now""?

I probably could have worded that better.

""Excuse me?""

Yup, judging by her sudden glare, I definitely could have worded it better. 

""Yeeah, what's with the vampire nonsense and the suddenly awful dialog?“ 

Maybe I shouldn't have doubled down but my dumbass ADHD brain was on a roll tonight

""Vampire nonsense? What? Give me that""

Luckily, that seemed to catch her attention. 
I quickly handed her the book before she could try to rip it out of my hands. 

After a few minutes of reading, I swear I could see the veins in her face like she was some kind of cartoon character.

""It seems I have to take another look at that publishing contract.""

As she spoke through a clenched jaw, her expression was simultaneously pained and enraged like someone hit a baboon with a whiffle bat as hard as they could. I backed away a bit. This wasn't good.

""Uhh...anything I can help you with?"" 

I was pretty lost at how to handle this and definitely did not want to be lashed out at. I tried the safe option. 

""If you could make me a drink and start dinner I'd appreciate it. I have a contract to read, a lawyer to call and an angry letter to write""

""Yes ma'am! Happy to help! Ummm... Good luck with that?“

She rubbed her temples and sighed loudly.

""...just shut up and get me that drink before you dig yourself a hole""

""Okay!"" 

I smiled at her as cheerfully as possible And that was that. I stifled my private chuckle as she groaned at me again.

I really do hope she gets this works out. I forsee a looong week ahead of me.",113,NaraFox257,2022-11-29 12:14:39

He told me it was his dream to publish a book. I already had an idea of what he was writing about. The style he was going for wasn't my cup of tea. 

I like books that are sweet, filled with love, and have happy endings. That kind that pulls your heart, filling your stomach with butterflies. 

His style was more dark, it pulls you in for a ride your not ready for. It left sprinkles of sweetness in the story, but it felt liked it was forced in.

I didn't want to read what he wrote. I told him how it made me feel and eventually he stop giving me a draft.

It wasn't until a year later when he published his book.

I forgot about it. I wouldn't have remember if it wasn't for my coworker. Sally ranted to me that it was the most tear-jerking, disgusting and the most romantic srory she has ever read. I  ask for the name of the book. She told me the name and author of the book.

I recongnize the author, it was my husbands pen name.

I asked Sally if I should read the book too. She was hesitant. She was pondering on the decision. She told me yes, but ready your heart.

After work, I stopped by the bookstore and asked for the book. The librarian nodded and retrive it for me. I grabbed the book from her hands. As i head for the door  the librarian told me, ""Be ready for the wonderful tale.""  I just waved back and walked off.

I wanted to read before i got home. I wanted to know what John wrote. I don't like theae kinds of books. But for my husband, I'll read it.



I don't have words to describe what I just read. From this however, I learned a lot of things about John. The way he weaved his words into my soul, crushing it and sooting it at the same time. About the ugliness and the beauty of it. I also know how he got the publishing job.

My legs are shaking, am I really scared to go back home? To meet John?

I was left with a question from the book, why? The book didn't answer it. 

I'll meet John to get that answered.

I made it home  the smell of the food penetrated my nose with an alluring aroma. John was in the kitchen, making dinner ready for tonight. 

""Welcome home, your just in time for dinner. Foods hot and ready."" John was smiling like he always does, it has  another meaning after reading the book.

""Hey John... i read your book.""

John paused in place. His face is not in view, i can't tell what he is thinking. 

I asked him "" Was everything in the book true?""

""Yes.""

""All the stuff about your coworkers?""

""Yes.""

""John if you needed help, I could've-""

""No.""

""But why John!?""

John refused to show me his emotion, he brought out a bag and dig around in it before pulling out a book. The exact book I had in my hand. He handed it to me.

""John I already read-""

the cover was diffrent. It didn't have the words of the title nor did it have his pen name.  All it said was:

    To Janet,

My Loving Wife

I carefully grabbed the book and start reading.

I got lost in it, it was sweet, every word in the page it filled with love, not only I got the the butterflies, I got the tinglies too. The little girl inside me was jumping with joy. The story was about me and John living happly ever after. A tear left me with joy.

""This is the reason why. I wanted to tell my love about you. I didn't want anyone else finding out about how much I love you. I learned it was embarrasing for me to tell that in public. I wanted you to know anyway. I wasn""t gping to give it to you half-washed. I waited till it was ready, till you were ready. To accept all of me.""

I couldn't help but to accept him. He made me very happy.

My only wish is that I didn't know why he kept his mouth so clean.

The more I stare at the picture, though, the more subtle differences I notice. I could definitely tell my wife from her twin in the picture; maybe for the fact that her smile never had that grinny appearance, maybe because her eyes are a lighter shade of brown...  
Wait, what color are my wife's eyes?  
With all the commotion, I haven't had time to notice, lately. I always complimented her about the expression of her eyes, their ability to communicate her feelings, her emotions to whoever she was talking to.

Until you find an old family photo of your wife as a kid, you shiver as you realise... they’re twins.",,3596,2022-11-30 00:31:27,iyclu3i,"After dropping the photo on the ground in complete and utter disbelief, I couldn't help but collapse onto the ground.

""What the actual fuck is going on here?"" I whispered to myself. I had no time to keep processing the shocking discovery I had just come across as I could hear ""Lauren"" coming down the basement stairs. Standing up as quick as I could I immediately headed towards her. This devil took MY wife away from me and was trying to steal MY wife's life? Oh hell no!

I got to the bottom of the stairs just before Hannah the succubus did and I couldn't contain the rage pumping through every copper wire in my being. 

""WHAT DID YOU DO?"" I wailed at the absolute top of my lungs, shaking my vocal cords. ""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO WITH LAUREN?"" This put a look of complete disbelief on her face. It actually seemed pretty genuine but I knew what type of game she was playing. There was no chance I was going to fall for it, there needed to be justice and revenge for Lauren. 

""I know who you are you psychopath! You think you can get away with this shit?"" Before I knew it I was grabbing her by the shoulders, shaking her violently. 

""Mark what the hell are you doing? What are you talking about?"" Hannah was fighting back, yet still trying to maintain her innocence. ""Babe get off me why are y-."" Her plea was cut short due to the state of both my hands clasping as tight as I could around her throat. 

""You stupid bitch, coming into my life and fucking it up. Huh? Nothing to say now huh?"" I continued to squeeze for the next 10 to 15 seconds at the same intensity, staring as deep as I could into the eyes of the woman who had murdered my wife. As her eyes started to close I released her. She went into a horrible coughing fit, covering the wall in her filth. 

""You won't feel the sweet release of death tonight Hannah, I'm going to make sure you rot in jail for the rest of your miserable life."" I said adamantly. I quickly headed up the stairs and grabbed the house phone to call the police. While dialing 911 I walked back to the top of the basement stairs to check on Hannah. I had revealed I knew her true identity and didn't want to take the chance of her escaping. As I saw she was still laying there, coughing more softly now, the 911 operator picked up.

""911 what is your emergency?""

""Hi, yes, I believe I have information on a murder case. I have the killer in my house right now and I need a unit here immediately!""

""Ok sir tell me your address and we'll have some officers down there right away."" The operator said in a very composed manner. After relaying that I lived at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Hannah decided to speak up again.

""Mark, honey, why are you doing this?"" She was struggling to get the words out of her crushed trachea. 

""Shut your mouth and stay right there, the police will be here any moment."" I quickly answered. I wasn't going to stand for her deceptive ways. The woman laying on the stairs was being of pure evil, one that needed to be treated as such. 

After a few more moments of Hannah's desperate pleading I heard a knock on the front door.

""Get ready for your twisted little sick life to get a lot worse demon."" I said to Hannah before heading to answer the door. 

Outside were three cop cars, an ambulance, and four officers crowded onto my porch.

""Hello sir we got a call about a possible domestic dispute. Can you tell me what's been going on tonight?"" The officer closest to the door asked. He seemed to be the Lieutenant or Sergeant as he wore a different badge than the other officers. This was the man I needed to be talking to. Before I could even get a word out, something happened I never could have expected.

Hannah came walking down the stairs from the second floor. She was in much worse shape than I had left her in on the stairs. There were multiple cuts on her face, her nose seemed to be broken, and there was a massive purple bruise on her left cheekbone.  While keeping her distance from me and after giving me a frightened look the officers could surely see, she began to speak. 

""Oh thank God you're here officers! He's been beating on me and I couldn't take it anymore!"" I almost believed her for a split second too. She sounded so innocent and heartbroken, like she's been battling with inner turmoil for a lifetime and finally decided to take action. She even had tears streaming down her face for dramatic effect. 

""Is this true sir?"" The officer in charge asked. I couldn't believe what the hell was happening. First she appeared upstairs, then the bruises and cuts appeared, and now she was feeding a bullshit story to the officers with the delivery of a seasoned Broadway actress. 

""Hell no this isn't true!"" I said with confidence, finally managing to get a word out. ""This woman here is a killer! She murdered my wife Lauren and is trying to steal her life! You have to believe me!"" My words seemed to have little to no effect on the officers. 

""Ma'am?"" The officer said inquisitively to Hannah.

""I don't know what he's talking about officer, he's gone crazy or something!"" Hannah said innocently. 

Looking back at me the officer sighed and pulled his handcuffs out. ""Please turn around and put your hands behind your back sir."" 

""What? No way I didn't do anything!"" I said defiantly. 

""Sir, turn around and put your hands behind your back NOW!"" The officer wasn't playing around now. I tried to think of what to do next and the officers took that as a sign of resistance. Within only a moment I had two sets of hands, one on each arm, turning me around and hand cuffing me. 

""You can't do this to me! She's a killer! A KILLER!"" I screamed as the officers dragged me away from my house. How did she do it? How did she get upstairs? How did she get those marks on her face? What the hell was happening right now? So much had happened in the last 10 minutes my head was spinning and I was beginning to feel sick. The officers read me my Miranda rights and threw me in the back of one of the squad cars. I could see Hannah spreading her lies to one of the officers who stayed to talk with her. He was writing down notes and probably believing every word she was saying. 

The officers who had detained me started to leave in their cars so I was forced to sit and watch Hannah give the rest of her statement. Once they finished talking and the officers started walking back towards their cars, Hannah stayed in the doorway to watch. She locked eyes with me and I could swear, was even smiling a little. Whoever that was, it wasn't Lauren. 

The officers drove me to the police station without saying a word. Once at the station I was processed and booked. My mug shot was taken, my fingerprint was filed, I was charged with first degree assault, and I was also charged with first degree battery. I thought, this can't be real. I had definitely choked her, but that was besides the point. The woman living in my home wasn't the woman I married. She had murdered my wife and was now trying to steal her life. 

Once processed I was given an orange Albuquerque prisoner jump suit and thrown into a tiny cell. The five foot by five foot ""room"" consisted of a piss stained cot and shit stained toilet. 

""Fuck."" I said quietly to myself. ""How did I end up here?"" I spent the next hour or so trying to process what my next steps would be. The charges against me weren't going to be dropped and there was no way that I could fight them after what happened at the house. All of the officers had seen a beat up, cut, and bruised woman cry before them about how she couldn't be abused anymore. Still though, I would eventually have a chance to seek out justice for Lauren. They couldn't lock me up forever because of this. 

After sitting in my cell for another hour or so my chance came sooner than I thought. An officer opened my cell door and told me a detective wanted to speak with me. I was escorted out of the cell block and taken to a private interrogation room. I waited for only a short time before a man walked in carrying a huge binder. He didn't wear a blue uniform like the rest of the cops, but instead khakis with a button shirt and a tie. His badge hung down from a lanyard covering part of his tie. He seemed to be about forty five to fifty years old, probably an experienced, grizzled cop who had seen a lot of shit in his day. He pulled his chair real close to mine, pinning me in the corner. 

""Hi Mark I'm detective Gary Fring, I've heard a lot about what's happened tonight so I just need to understand what happened from your side. Tell me your version of events from tonight at the house."" Detective Fring seemed to be reasonable and willing to listen.",121,humanpersonguy69,2022-11-30 04:05:53

I throw my arm across my face and roll onto my front. As I brought a knee up to stand, I am bumped over by a large enthusiastic dog siding up to my left with the speed of puppy hood. You know how a happy dog can feel like a lot of dogs? This dog feels that way. The dog turns back. I get a good look at it for the first time right as it jumps up to continue its attempt to lick my face. 

The dog has three heads. 

""Down!"" I say, trying to turn my head to avoid the French kiss that dogs seem to aim for. I am just bearly successful. It has a head licking me from both sides and front. 

I bring an arm up from trying to push the dog's body back to cover my mouth as I command, ""Down!""  

It works this time. The dog drops onto my feet and attempts to roll up my legs. It is rolling over to show me his belly; one head looking to at me with pleading eyes. One head tries to push it over farther onto me. One head is licking its head looking at me.  I reach down to start scratching the dog's/ dogs' belly. 

I look around as I kept scratching the dog(s). Maybe it is just one dog? The dog and I are on the shore of a river. There is a person working on a small boat. He is  a ways down the shore.

""Hey!"" I call to the boater, ""I like you dog!"" 
The worker waves an arm to me in acknowledgement, but then continues to ignore me.

My thoughts grow from just focusing on the dog to... oh my God! The car accident! Did everyone get out?! I remember the accident. I remember reaching through broken glass unbuckling the kid from a car seat. I remember diving through a shattered driver's side window, reaching for the buckle trying to get the driver loose. I remember the impact of another car as I was trying to get back out the window. 

I start sobbing. The dog squirms back over to its feet. It sits in front of me. Two heads hang low, with eyes looking up at me. The center head gives a couple tentive licks. My chin. My cheek. 

I feel overwhelmed my fear. Sadness. I failed. I died. 

I burry my head between two of the dog's; the crook warm and musky. I wrap my arms up and around its large body. As The sobs slowly subside, the dog starts to squirm. I let him go from my tight, desperate embrace. 

He runs to the boat man and back to me. The boat man follows the dog my way.

I turn away to dry my face. Then stare at the water quietly lapping the muddy shore. 

""He is Cerberus. He loves everyone. Did you want to give him a couple treats?"" Says the man as he comes closer.

""Yes!"" I say finally looking the man in his face. 

He smiles kindly and drops three dog treats and an old coin into my hand. 

""Cerberus is silly, you can't just feed one head or he sits there drooling at you with all three."" The man explains. 

He looks away from me and asks, ""Do you have a coin to pay the ferryman?""

I feed Cerberus his three treats. 

""I do."" I tell the man handing him his coin back. 

He leads me to the boat. Cerberus runs through the water's edge and back up onto the bank. All three of us climb into the boat.",478,througthetulips,2023-03-06 03:13:31

He eagerly ran past Hades to greet an old friend, who typically had an aromatic, earthy smell of citrus and spice. But today he smelt of blood and burns.

For Hades, this was a worrying sign. He had been planning for a few years on how to bring up the topic of these recurring visits by a member of a foreign pantheon. The frequency of these visits had been increasing at an alarming rate for these past few years.

Near the gates of the underworld, Hades was greeted by the sight of Cerberus licking terrible wounds from a strange creature with 6 scorched, blackened wings and numerous eyes, half of which were oozing blood.

""Greetings, King Hades, I apologize for taking up Cerberus, but he has been the best therapy dog I've ever met in the various pantheons. He has proven instrumental in helping me to maintain my sanity.""

""Explain, I rarely venture beyond the underworld due to how busy it can get, but I need to know why you are here for the 6th time this month. What in your world is going on? Who did this to you?"" Hades enquired.

""My accursed brother...after serving his sentence of a thousand years, restarted the war between the Fallen and our kind. He seems to take perverse pleasure in repeatedly murdering me and mutilating my vessels.""

""You Abrahamic angels have a healer among your kind, your repeated intrusions into my underworld just to see Cerberus for therapy is unwarranted. Go to Raphael if you have to. Good thing he can heal all kinds of wounds and mental illnesses, isn't it?""

""But I am Raphael...everyone in Heaven keeps saying it is a good thing I can heal, but I have been pushed beyond my limits. These recent deaths I have suffered are horribly traumatic. These wounds do not heal instantaneously. Please, I need time.""

Cerberus snuggled up to the angel, who still has his injured wings curled around the dog in a tight embrace.

Hades sighed, ""How long will you need Cerberus? I can tell he is very fond of you, but do not overstay your welcome.""

""I will only stay for a few days. I will leave when my physical vessel has fully reformed and I am alive again. I will not loiter unnecessarily. Like you, I have much work to do as well, I have to heal so many innocents who have been wounded and injured because of Lucifer's futile, senseless war.""

Hades pondered for a moment before replying. This issue about Raphael hogging so much of Cerberus' therapy time had to be addressed urgently.

""You can stay here for all your therapy needs with Cerberus, for as long as you need to be fully functioning. You will be welcome if you need his therapy services again, for as long as Lucifer continues to be a massive douchebag.

Meanwhile, I am going to have a stern word with your father NOW.""",270,Tregonial,2023-03-06 02:05:15

I was wearing a helmet and reflective jacket, wheels lined with LEDs. It's true that my tail light was burned out, but that electric bike ran straight into me, flipping my bike sideways into bridge traffic. When the VW van screeched on its brakes it was already too late. The impact sent me and my bike straight over the guardrail, into the night sky over the bridge. The stars I saw were real, and I prayed to all of them, please, merciful burning balls of gas, images coming from light years away, let my death be swift and merciful. But that is not the way it happened. While floating through the air I had time to reflect on how sixty years seemed way too short to make up for my ignorance when I was a young father--how I let my exes take my children without a fight--how I thought cash was enough compensation--how my eldest was now forty, and I didn't know where he was. My legs throbbed with pain where the car had struck them, and drops of my own blood salted my lips while I spun through that aerial eternity. Then, I landed, on my back. Not exactly in the river nor out, but on those rocks the kids jump from a few hundred feet from the shore. I guess the deities might have answered the ""merciful"" part of my prayer with paralysis. I didn't feel my injuries, or anything else. Unfortunately, I was still breathing and conscious for several hours. I'm not sure how death finally took me, but damn, Cerberus, you're the first being who's listened to me in decades.

""I hear what you're saying and I feel your pain. Before we enter the eternal realm I'd like you to take a moment to breathe into your whole being, close your eyes, and tell me what's going on inside

""Cerberus, I just want to pet you. Please.. Your golden fur...

A low growl from two of the heads.

""That ""what I want"" part of your existence is finished

""I thought...someone said...aren't you a therapy dog?

It had fallen from a brick wall, and in its eyes, I saw tremendous fear. Such a terror was the worst enemy of these creatures, they could become afraid enough that it could kill them outright. I could heal the wounds to its legs, but I could not restore it from the grave. My instinct was wholly to save it, and the wise words of my mentor were lost on me when I entered its mind; all I wanted to do was calm its nerves, to comfort it, as we would all wish to be comforted. 

Through the doorway I expected the emotions of a shivering child; tears and screams. Instead, there was nothing but bright white. In the pointed center of my vision, I saw a gold dot. As I walked closer, it took on the form of a golden ring. When I stood in front of it, I could see a pale translucent red material in the middle. Only when it blinked did I realize it was an eye. 

I gasped and stepped back, reaching for my wand in my pocket but realizing that I had no form. This was strange, for I always had a form in my subjects. 

Then the eye turned an opaque gray. Shapes came from the edges and began to coalesce. The first thing I noticed was the jade color of my boots, then the rest of the castle garden came into focus. My feet were swinging back and forth like the pendulum of a clock. I was so entranced in the image that I almost didn't see words forming outside of the eye in the whitespace. ""Elves are so difficult to work with."" ""Argh!"" ""Why did that wand cost me an extra two gold?"" 

Strange, I thought, for these were clearly *my own* thoughts. How? 

The more they appeared, the more I realized that the rabbit knew absolutely everything about me. Nothing was spared, from my deepest fantasies to my most banal mutterings about the weather. 

*But...* It couldn't be the rabbit.  I'd never seen it before, I just encountered it while I was... sitting on the wall. It stumbled, then fell, then I leaped after it to save it. How was this possible? Where were the emotions? The terror? The scared little bunny whom I was about to save?

The scene on the wall played back in my mind again and again, and as it did, it slowly occurred to me that things might not have happened the way I thought. Who fell first? Did I fall first? Could the rabbit have leaped... to save me? No, not at all possible. Rabbits don't possess that kind of intelligence. 

Or do they?

Gulping lightly, She looked at his pale blue eyes. Searching for help through occultist and new age foruns proved fruitless, a myriad of people searching for ghosts and freaks were they are not. Until, mysteriously, She stepped on the man's path. Terry felt another thought inside her skull, asking for how long could she read what other people were thinking.

Jumping, and making a scene in the small library, Terry took a look at the man with balding grey hair and unkempt beard. A stereotype of a mystic, almost a modern day Rasputin. He introduced himself as Virgil, and invited the girl for a coffee.

""We are anomalies."" He said, monotonously; the way his face changed, one almost saw a smirk under the thick moustache. ""Born on the brink of extinction and, as someone once advised me...""

""You now pass the set of rules for me."" Concluding the line of thought. ""Have your mentor explained the *why* of these rules?""

The man showed some teeth, in a surprisingly warm smile.

""Ah... indeed, talented minds indeed.""

He looked through the window, towards the cloudy sky, and took another sip of the coffee from his white mug.

""You not only can read thoughts, but also search for them."" He began, the smile fading away. ""One day, you can be on a happy married life, then your curiosity wins. Suddenly, your wife is thinking about divorce; your husband is having an affair with the neighbour and your kids are not yours. Or worse, your mother regrets not having an abortion when she had the chance."" He put his gaze back at yours. ""You'd be surprised at how many readers prefer death over life with this information.""

She took the mug to her lips but did not drink the hot beverage. The information was enough to digest.

""And I guess, the second rule is because I don't want to spend the rest of my days as a test subject.""

The man silently nodded.

""What about the third rule?""

""It's better to take my word for it.""

His words were not enough. In her apartment, Terry laid on a small couch with a blanket covering her legs, her gaze fixed in Pandora. A white cat, between six and eight years old. She laid on a rug, with the tail covering herself, almost making her look like a pillow. With the silence on the house, her purring could be heard from their distance. She appeared mysteriously on a walk a few blocks to the right.

What could be so terrible in the mind of a cat? An eldritch horror? Some sophisticated thoughts?

Taking a deep breath. The reader felt the familiar sensation. Imagine that your mind is extending an arm and touching a box. You can feel its smoothness and sharp corners. All you have to do is... open.

No voice, or thought, erupted in her mind. Rather, it was like a film. A dream where you're vividily paid attention to your surroundings. Everything was so large, or, maybe, she was so small. The floor was close to her view, almost as if she was laying on it directly, made of mahogany. She wanted to look around, to move her neck, but she couldn't. The view of the floor kept for a full minute. Until a creaking sound made itself known. Terry felt the tension course through her body.

With heavy steps, there was a man. He was wet, or maybe sweaty? His rugged features and black hair weren't strange... from memory, he could be the butcher or the baker, that she saw whenever she had to do groceries. Something moved in her back, and then, from her mouth, a low hissing sound came.

She wasn't Terry, right now. Well, not only Terry.

The man looked at her and gave a dry chuckle. ""Still mad at me, stupid?!"" He said, without looking at her/them.

He sat on an armchair with thorn tissue, and grabbed his phone. While his thumb scrolled up, he made a shushing sound twice, until looking at them; he moved fast, grabbing a shoe and threw at them.

Pandora's reflexes were good. She dodged easily.

""Big fucking deal. Your *kittens* were put on a bag"" He said with venom on his voice. ""And I got rid of them, I made sure I did correctly, just so you learn to not act like a slut on my house, got it?""

The movie was interrupted by a brusque sensation that made Terry, the real one, fall on the ground, rolling the blanket on her legs. The sleeping cat, Pandora, woke up startled.

She could not contain the tears in her eyes as she walked closer to the cat and extended her hand towards the animal. That let a small meow escape her mouth and touched the hand with her forehead.

For the rest of the night, Terry stood there, scratching and holding the cat, while sobbing helplessly.",188,Archimedes_go_away,2023-04-24 19:37:51

# Soulmage

**""But... aren't humans... also animals?""** I asked.

""Correct. This is why artificial beings, such as your clockwork friend, are the easiest subjects on which to develop the ability of perceiving and altering the minds of others,"" Zhytln explained.

For the sixth time this meeting, I reflexively flicked through my soul, trying to catch any sign of foreign intrusion. Maybe Lucet's caution was seeping into me—she hadn't even shown up, insisting on an air gap between her and a known mind manipulator—but part of me was also curious as to what Zhytln meant.

""I've looked into my own soul countless times,"" I said. ""And into the souls of others, on occasion. I haven't... I dunno, turned into a quivering pile of insane flesh, or anything.""

""Technically speaking, with our current assumptions about the size of the universe and the probability with which biological minds can spontaneously arise, it is more likely that you *are* a brain assembled by the random motion of dust, hallucinating the entirety of your life, than that you are one of the relatively few minds on our world,"" Zhytln noted.

""Wait, what?""

""But yes, casual glimpses into soulspace—which are needed for all conscious applications of magic—will not strain your mind overmuch. The issue is when you attempt to comprehend your soul in its totality.""

""Could you go back to the part where I might be a brain-damaged dust bunny?""

""I recommend not worrying about it; there is little you could do about it if it *were* the case."" Zhytln paused, tilting her head. ""Although I suppose your distress at the moment is representative of the issue as a whole.""

Complaining that I wasn't distressed was a futile endeavor towards a mind-reader. ""So, what, looking too deeply into anyone's soul will... give me a cosmic case of existential horror?""

""In a way."" Zhytln held up a hand, and I half-expected her to begin casting a light spell to demonstrate, but instead she withdrew... what was that, a tablet and chalk stick? ""Tell me—what is the size of a soul?""

""That's not a meaningful ques—"" The line I'd learned at the Silent Academy came to mind on instinct, and I trailed off mid-sentence as Zhytln gave me a disappointed look. ""Souls are... I dunno. Big? They have to hold all your memories and emotions, and I've never noticed a soul *run out* of space.""

""'Big' is imprecise but accurate,"" Zhytln conceded, sketching something on her chalkboard. The diagram sort of looked like two thought bubbles ballooning out from two crude figures' heads. ""A surface skim of soulspace will only reveal the most currently active portion of a soul. But if you widen your perspective, and attempt to view an entire soul at once...""

I did as she said, focusing on my awareness of my soul. The coal crags of exhaustion and quartz cliffs of determination were first in my mind, but those were far from the only lenses available to me. I flicked my attunements like lenses over each other, letting me see the rivulets of bleeding fear and grinding-gravel of irritation and shimmering gold of arrogance and—

And in viewing them all at once, something *clicked*. The cliffs and crags and rivulets and gravel and gold snapped into focus as a *planet*, an entire fucking planet of emotions and memories in my soul, and holy *shit* were there *living beings* on that introspective orb? My nose started to bleed as the sheer scope of matter I was trying to process at once abraded at my brain—

Zhytln slapped me. Physically, literally slapped me. The glimmering planet in my mind disappeared, although not before I saw-sensed-felt electric thunder-clouds of shock cascade into existence across the world of my soul at Zhytln's strike. 

""Did I not *just* tell you that looking at the totality of your soul was ill-advised?"" Zhytln demanded. Her chalk stick had broken in two—did she slap me with that thing still in her hand? 

""You told me to—""

""I couched the action of viewing your soul in a hypothetical, for the purpose of elucidation *only*."" Zhytln massaged her forehead. 

""There's an entire world inside my soul,"" I managed to say. ""Fuck, is there an entire *inhabited planet* inside every living creature? What—what happens when someone dies? Do they—""

""This is why I wanted to start with an artificial mind. I'm not going to be able to educate you while you're still working off the implications."" She stood up, pocketing the remnants of her chalk. ""This meeting is adjourned. Come to our next session *only* if you can sit still and follow directions.""

I was barely listening as she ushered me out of the bar. Because, like it so often did, my mind took a fascinating insight into how magic worked on a fundamental level and immediately applied it to explaining why I, in particular, should feel as maximally awful as possible.

If everyone carried their own world inside them—and if that world vanished upon their death—then the death of a single being was tantamount to genocide.

And I had killed before. Despite the erasure of memory which I had come to Zhytln to learn, it still blazed bright in my mind.

I shambled out of the bar in a stupor, wondering how many souls weighed on my back.

""You probably think that last part is a joke but trust me; one glimpse into a horse and you won't be right for a week.""",,3288,2023-04-24 16:45:37,jhmk8o5,"""But why, Grandpa?""

""Because we're used to being the masters of most animals. We're used to being in control. We're smarter, can plan better, can imagine, can... in nearly every mental capacity we're stronger. But in that relational... collective... act is a realm where those tables are turned.

Carol had listened to her grandfather. She'd followed the rules religiously for 15 years. And that was how she found herself in a faux-saloon rest-stop, 50 miles outside of nowhere.

""You going to join us at the card table tonight?"" Carol's lips quirked as she brought the whiskey glass to her lips.

Henry shook his head as he twisted the dishrag around the inside of a glass. ""No thank you. I'd like to keep my paycheck this week.""

""Suit yourself.""

""I still don't understand why you're here. The local dude ranch is barely eeking by, and it looks like New York compared to the rest of the county. Luck like yours, you should be in Vegas. You'd rake in millions.""

""Three reasons: I hate neon lights and love clean air and cheap whiskey."" Carol sauntered back over to the card table. She didn't share the real reason. Vegas had plenty of professionals, both gambler and house. People who would notice something amiss, someone who bet when she shouldn't. That would violate rule #2. But out here? WIth fat tourists, high on wrangling Bessie, wanting one last taste of the West, and disappearing tomorrow? Why getting cheated at cards was part of the fun!

As Carol sat down at the far end of the table, this week's crop ambled in through the swinging doors. A middle-aged mother with her teenage brood. A high school group in matching club T-shirts. An elderly german. Pickins looked pretty slim.

Then they rolled in. Six rowdy frat guys, bouncing off the walls and each other. Spotting the card table, they made a beeline for it, sending one of their number to grab drinks for the rest of them. A tall guy with a cleft chin dropped into the char on her right. A wiry beanpole with wire glasses and wirier hair sat to her left. And directly across from Carol, a tanned trust-fund (complete with popped collar and immovable hair) slide into the chair.

Betting was light at first, but got looser as empty glasses began to litter the table. Carol tried not to take too much from any one of them, and with the frat boys chasing shots and flush draws with equal abandon, it wasn't too bad. Mostly. But Trust-fund kept betting bigger the worse his cards were. Once, after calling her raises twice, he folded on the third.

""WHHHHHHHAAAAAT!"" screamed Cleft-chin.

""Weak-sauce."" chided the Wire.

Trust-fund turned an ugly scarlet and muttered something about 'Pot-odds'.

""Whatever, dude, you're just scared of her.""

After that, Carol tried to cool down her betting, but Trust-Fund wasn't having it. Whenever she bet, he bet bigger. When she raised, he re-raised. She even tried losing a few hands, but no matter how many she gave away, Trust-fund kept coming for her. Pretty soon, she was getting tired of folding even just the blind with pocket pairs to a 2-3 unsuited. So, when he pulled 2 Kings to her pocket Aces, she took him to the cleaners.

As she reached out to take her winnings, his hand clamped onto her wrist. His blurry eyes burned red at her and his words stank of so much alcohol, they were flammable as well as inflamatory. ""Cheated. Win big. Lose small. Cheated.""

""Let go, goatlicker.""

""Hey, don't call Rich a goatlicker!""

""Both of you need to calm-""

Carol tossed the remains of her drink in Rich's face, kicked Cleft in the shin, and ran for the door. Once outside in the cool night air, she ran down the road and ducked into an alley between the stable and the general store. Angry voices rang out in the street and angry thoughts resounded in the minds behind her as she circled back around and crawled under a stable wall. Croached behind some musty hay, she listened.

""Where is she?""

""I don't know!""

""This place isn't that big, look again!""

She shrank back as flashlights passed over the loose slats. For a while she even held her breath, until their voices dwindled. At last, she couldn't find any more minds in the street, and stood up. Brushing dust off her jeans, she stretched her cramping legs.

Something shifted behind her in the dark. In a panic, she threw her mind toward the unseen figure. Only as the world began to turn grey, and a tinny jangle of notes started up in her head did Carol realize her mistake.

That's what her old mentor said.

Hence, Tessa turned down Harry when he requested for a divination. They may have drifted apart over the years, but she was not going to risk trying to read the mind of her former boyfriend.

Rule Number Two, don't reveal your powers. That was the next thing the old man emphasized when Tessa first learned she was a mind-reader. This is why she masquerades as a fortune-teller and diviner who could speak to the dead.

She heard the bell ring outside her makeshift tent as a man stepped inside with a golden retriever in tow.

""Oh Tessa the Terrific, Becca has been very unhappy ever since my mother passed away and I want to know what's on her mind. I want to know how to cheer my girl up, please.""

Rule Number Three, NEVER try to read animals. In her mind, she could still remember vividly seeing the old man shivered as he told her the third rule. ""You probably think that last part is a joke, but trust me, one glimpse into a horse and you won't be right for a week. Don't even think about it. EVER.""

""Tessa the Terrific, can you hear me?""

Tessa snapped back to her senses. ""My divination only applies to humans, I am afraid dogs are on a different frequency that I cannot interpret.""

This customer wasn't phased. ""That's okay. Would you be able to call upon my mother's ghost to communicate with Becca? Becca really misses her.""

Tessa gazed into the man's mind, poring over his memories of his mother. She sampled every word the woman once said, savoured the sweet memories of the old lady playing with the dog Becca, and tasted the bittersweet moments as the old lady grew too weak to care for Becca. After a deep breath and a few seconds to compose herself, Tessa was ready for her act.

The dog was a little confused at first but slowly warmed up to the strange woman who embodied so much behavioral traits of her favourite person in the world. She spoke the soothing words in the voice of the old lady she saw in the man's mind and gave a gentle smile to both man and dog.

The man gave her a warm hug, tears streaming down his face, and he put down a twenty-dollar bill on her table. Tessa returned his hug and held his face in her hands the same gentle way his mother used to hold him. This was too easy, she told herself. Another simple-minded townsfolk at Innsmouth buying into her tricks. Bunch of ignorant, stupid bumpkins who lapped up everything she fed them.

It was good business, with a steady trickling of customers, especially a couple of repeat customers who repeatedly threw money at her to contact lost loved ones. It got to the point where she jacked up her prices and started installment plans for the poor who couldn't afford a regular package of monthly communications with the dead whom they sorely missed.

Then one day, a letter with no name was on her table. ""Kindly stop what you are doing. Not everyone can afford your services. Please stop charging exorbitant prices.""

She threw it into the bin.

At the start of another bright morning, a second letter flew into her tent. ""Please leave. Please stop swindling people.""

How low effort. Tessa discarded the letter again.

Today, she stepped into her makeshift tent to find a man seated at the table waiting for her early in the morning.

""Good morning, Tessa the Terrific. I've heard so much about you. They say you're really good at divination and communicating with the dead, but you have the aura of a mind-reader.""

Tessa froze in her tracks. She had always did her best to abide by the three rules. She didn't think she did anything to reveal her powers. How did he know? Who is this man?

""Now, where are my manners? I'm sorry I didn't properly introduce myself. I'm Elliot, would it be possible for you to reach out to my mother? I'm personally not sure if it's a good idea, let me know if you won't do it.""

There was a Rule Number Four somewhere, but it escaped Tessa's mind. It was probably something important, but rarely applicable. So much for Rule of Three, but the first three rules were more commonplace and relevant.

""Of course, I can do it."" Tessa replied bursting with confidence. 

Tessa sat across the table from the strange young man and looked into his eyes to scan his thoughts. But there was nothing she could read, just a strange impenetrable thick fog in his mind. She could swear she spied a smug smirk on the man's face as she tried to concentrate harder and gaze deeper into his eyes and mind to catch a glimpse of what he was thinking. 

""You should stop right there. Consider this a final warning."" Came a cold whisper she pushed to the side.

Undeterred, she forcibly peeled a small section of the fog away, only for dark tendrils to grasp her mind, caressing it with a cold touch. The tendrils pulled her face towards his until she could barely see anything but fathomless, deep violet eyes, an impossibly darkened night sky dotted with ancient stars in his pupils.

She tried to scream but no words could come out of her mouth. He was a fellow telepath and mind-reader, but a much more powerful one at that, and there was nothing she could do to stop all her thoughts, memories, and emotions from being laid bare before him.

""I don't appreciate you scamming and swindling my people out of their hard-earned money. I have heard how a few are taking out loans and paying you by installment plans in a futile belief you could actually call upon the dead. No, dead mortals should stay dead, my people should move on than cling onto those who are no longer of this world.""

Tessa wasn't even sure if she was in her tent at all. Her surroundings was a dark cavernous tunnel, where soft, pinkish minced meat moss poured out on the floor, and a mysterious dark liquid pooled under her feet. The walls were breathing, pulsating masses of flesh, and the ceiling meshed with wiry weaves of membrane and mucus.

She could not close or tear her eyes away from the man or everything she saw. She could not get up and run, her feet firmly held in place by dark tendrils as the black water rose above her ankles and reached her knees. The man's eye sockets were hollowing out, murky black waters spilling forth from them. His mouth tore itself open to emit a reverberating echo.

**Rule Number Four. If you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. And there is no escape when an eldritch god of the Abyss has his sights on you.**

**I am Lord Elvari, Eldritch Lord of the Black Seas, local deity of Innsmouth. You have ignored my final warning, Charlotte Weaver, and it will cost you.**

-----

It was said that the woman born Charlotte Weaver, now mostly known as the diviner and ghost whisperer Tessa the Terrific, ran screaming from Innsmouth for days and never looked back. She never packed her tent, never collected the money on her table, she just ran and never stopped until she fell onto the pavement completely exhausted.

We don't know what happened to her, her mind is shattered, and all she does is babble incoherently about the Abyss. We will never know what she truly saw that day, because she had clawed her eyes out. We tried asking around but the townsfolks didn't seem to have a clue. The only thing we learned from their friendly local deity was that she gazed too deeply into the Abyss and glimpsed into things no human mind-reader should have tried to see.

They are there for a reason

That being?

You don't want to know what your loved ones are thinking,the last time someone disregard that they fell into a depression and killed themselves a month after(kinda happens when your SO is a Piece of shit)

And the one with the animals?

I'm not gonna think of it,otherwise it will spread to you too

It can't be that bad Right?(is he exaggerating?)

I'm not

20 bucks says your just weak

Deal,but please don't do it with any predator,try a herbivore first,fine I'll just see some sheep then


A week later

*Slams 20 dollars on the table* what was that? 

We don't know,most people kill themselves before they explain

*Looks around nervous for ANY animal* since when do all animals have become Eldridge abominations,of the n dimension? 

Probably forever,since these rules have been in place forever 

Why didn't you tell me?

Because you wouldn't listen(not the first time)

What you mean not the first time?

You thing you're the first person to get warned about it and still went through?

No, but seems like it wasn't the second or the third time this happened either, was it?

Nah,your is probably shy of the millionth time this decade

That doesn't explains why you don't take bigger precautions 

Already tried it, so give it a rest

I... had the most *peculiar* of dreams, dear. I- I was a caveman, you see? A proper caveman - like one you'd see in a museum. And I believe a... meteor fell on me? Oh my. I- I might be faint-headed. Say, could you perhaps fetch the physician? I believe he told me to take some of the laudanum if another spell came across me. Take the carriage and bring him right away, will you? Thank you, dear.

***6.***

My *humblest* thanks for seeing me, Oracle. I- I need you to beseech Apollo or his noble son, Asclepius, to aid me. I am haunted by the most dreadful visions - visions of lives I've not lived, in the strangest times. Lives that seem to be those of men stuck in the distant past or women in a time so far from now I know not how they could be possible. These visions are... the most vivid you could ever imagine, yet from godhood they are not - it must be a curse. Please, fair Oracle, allow me to beg the Immortals for mercy through you - and, of course, offer a humble offering of drachmae.

***168.***

There's no other way around it. They're not dreams. Not hallucinations. I've had this thought process far too many times to ignore it. The information I know is far too precise to be coincidental. They're... memories of past lives. Actual past lives. I- I know it sounds impossible, but... modern neuroscience and psychiatry have failed me; is an outlandish explanation such as this not possible? I need a drink.

***172,596.***

I've just met a man - a fine young man - today, whose face felt familiar. I first thought him a friend I made during the battle of Tsushima when the Mongols invaded, but no. He was... *me*. From when I fought in Tsushima before, thousands of lives ago. I didn't know this was possible! That another life could exist in the same time. This is... a most concerning notion. I must meditate on it.

***49,862,123,114.***

There's nothing here. Nothing except me. It's just... me, over and over again.

I recognize them. *So, so many of them* \- my previous lives, heroes and scoundrels, fair and horrific, and some of them, only a few, recognize me, so... I'm not even the last. I play my parts, I live my lives, compelled by some... primal, unseen drive, forcing me to do things I don't quite want, hurting myself in the past and future, saving them in the next life. But some of them recognize me, leading to one, terrible conclusion - I'm just another member of the chain, the infinite line of lives ahead of me, staring at the line behind me.

As I sit here at the foot of the temple and see a past version of me asking me to beseech Apollo and Asclepius, I can't help but wonder.

Is this Hell?

***991,413,761,833.***

I'm 47 years into this iteration and it's... promising. I haven't seen a single face I've not seen before; haven't met a single version of me that I don't recall. That - that means that this could be it! At long, *long* last, this could be...

Focus. Let's see... engines are doing fine, approach vector is perfect. A little shaky but that's to be expected. I'm... anxious. For the first time in what is right next to forever. Gods, it's been billions of years since I've last been anxious. It feels **exhilarating**!

If the trillions of calculations are correct, I should slip by the event horizon unharmed and fly into the singularity. If the *other* calculations, the cumulative work of billions of lives working in unison, are *also* true, then the singularity of this black hole is not a singular point, but a ring. Which means that I could fly *through* it.

Beyond that, it's a wild guess, even for me. Sometimes I theorised that for information to be preserved past the even horizon, there could be an alternative history, one *with* the black hole, the other *without* it - a parallel universe. A place where I could meet someone *else*.

Or perhaps I'll just get crushed into an infinitely dense point, but maybe - *just maybe* \- I finally won't come back from this one.

Almost naked on that cool autumn night, scraping decades of dirt and moss from the dates and names on the tombstones. When I gave him my coat he said it was his anyway as he shivered it around him.

”You sure you’re okay?”

“I’m alone,” he said. “Totally. Utterly. Alone. How can I be okay ever again?“

“Hey, I’m here too,” I said, waving a hand. “If you’re alone then we’re alone together.”

“Yes, exactly — that’s what I mean!” He turned on the spot gesturing to the graves around us. “Don’t you see, these were all me.”

“These were all you?“

“Yes. Listen, I was in an accident.”

That explained it, I thought. I took out my phone to call an ambulance, dialled.

”Wait. Listen. I was in an accident and now I remember it all, sort of. Snatches of it, of time. Handfuls of sand. Things you’re not meant to see. Do you understand?“

A voice on the other end of my phone. I said to it, “Someone’s been in an accident. I think there’s head trauma or something.“ I looked at the man’s face but couldn’t see any marks or blood. Still, I gave our location.

The man continued unperturbed, “You see, reincarnation is the name of the game. That’s the key. There’s only one person — us. Looping. The world is populated by one person! But god, how could we do such fucked up things to ourself? Tell me that! Think of the pain I caused.“

“You’re the only person in existence?“ I said, figuring I might as well keep him talking until the cavalry arrived.

”Right! Now you’re listening. We’re both alone with all the terrible things we’ve done to ourself.”

”Good things, too,“ I say, playing along.

”*What?”*

”Well, we’ve cured diseases. We’ve played Cupid a billion times over. Hell, we built the pyramids single handed. You should be kinder to yourself.”

He tilted his head. “Yes... I suppose we did some good, too. But it was all selfish good. All ego driven.”

”Self love isn’t selfish. My therapist says—“

He pushed past me to the row of fresh tulips behind and read the engraving outloud: “*Francesca.*” His eyes flicked up at me.

I sighed. “We were going to get married. Then some guy checked a text while she was crossing and... And we didn’t get married. He got a year.“

He stared at me, startled-wide eyes, animal in headlight, unsure which way to dart so it just stays put. “I remember. Of course I do. Sort of. Feelings, you know? Like the color of different lights.”

That pissed me off more than a little. I knew he was unwell but if he was now pretending to be my dead girlfriend then this wasn’t going to go well for either of us.

”Yes. A green feeling. You helped me beat it,” he said.

”Excuse me?”

”Whatever it was. I can’t remember. But I was ill before and that’s why we were getting married. Life is too short, right?”

The graveyard shrubs blossomed wish flashes of red.

“Who are you?” I said.

“I told you.”

And then people are around us. They hold the man gently, help him walk towards the gate. He turned to me then and said, “Your coat.”

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t.

”We loved you,” he said. “We still do. And we’re sorry for what we did. You should be kinder to yourself. Forgive yourself.”

Then he was gone and I was alone.

Filled to the brim, spilling over with nothingness. A blank slate. Blanker than a slate, blanker than anything that could possibly be imagined and stretching further than a clear night sky. It wasn't that nothing existed, it was that there was nothing to exist. 

Then I blinked. I awoke. And then, there was something. It was me, I, the first and only. Now I didn't remember such an event so it could not have been very significant, but nowadays people, other me's mostly, make such a ruckus about it. The ""Big Bang"" they've taken to calling it. Why they went with bang I will never know. Then again, it technically was just another me who had first called it such so something in my brain somewhere felt bang to be an appropriate word. I did not. 

Then I died. Another very forgettable event. But apparently I must have enjoyed it because I proceeded to do it again, and again, and again. Some terribly painful: a spear through the chest or lungs full of water; others almost relaxing: in a bed by loved ones or resting in a field. But always the same. Always waking up as a new me until somewhere along the line it was only me. Had only ever been me's. 

And suddenly that vast nothingness the universe spilled over with before was replaced and now spilled over with me. Until I could not not see it anymore. After a billion reincarnations it became clear that there was never anything that wasn't me.

George Washington? Me. 

That one guy on the Price is Right? Me (hell, and it turns out I was the host too). 

That other guy on the Price is Right? Also me. 

Something strange happens when one consciousness realizes that everyone is them. It's not like they all realize it as you'd hope, no, in fact they believe the one to be crazy. They pin him to a cross or let him rot beneath a bridge. They label him as crazy and tell him he must see a shrink, a shrink who is also him in disguise beneath a white coat and a degree. And he thinks he is better than me because of his education, but I think I am him because I am. 

It all spills over but they cannot see, they do not care. Their throats do not close and their brains do not break, only yours does. And you come to the final realization over and over again, the realization that if everyone is everyone, and everything is everything, that nothing truly ever matters. That maybe it never did. That maybe all of these lives and all of this energy mean nothing in comparison to the true nothingness the universe once had. 

The final knowing is that it is easier to be a man than a prophet. Nobody likes a prophet who tells the truth.

“My name is Mathew and I think you have had enough, sir.” The young bartender kindly refused.

“GREG, GROG, IT DOESN’T MATTER. THIS AIN’T DOING SHIT TO ME, I HAVE HAD ALL THE FUCKING BEERS EVER SPITTED OUT ONTO THIS HELL HOLE OF A WORLD AND YOUR SMART ASS IS DENYING ME A FUCKING DROPLET WHEN I HAVE DRANK THE FUCKING OCEAN. I HAVE LIVED AS YOU, YOUR FATHER AND THE WHORE HE FUCKED BEHIND YOUR MOTHER’S BACK.”

“Sir, you are being too loud, so I am asking you to leave, please.”

“AYYYYYY, NEVERMIND. I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR BEING SO MISTAKEN. I CAN’T IMAGINE BEING YOUR FATHER, SO I MUST HAVE FUCKED A PIG TO HAVE SHAT OUT TWAT LIKE YOU OUT OF MY OWN FLESH AND BONE.” He declared before choking on what little beer he had left in his throat as a keen eye watched next to him.

“That’s it.” The bartender held him by the clothes to drag him out, but the old man put up a nasty fight as he moaned and cursed.

“Please, my friend here had a rough night.” A young soldier suddenly interjected. “His mind has been very misty since ever since last night. He had to pillage a Khazalian settlement.”

The bartender crossed his arms with a look of disbelief.

“Just let him have one more mug and I promise to take him out of your hair soon.” He begged as the old soldier began mumbling incoherent words from an unknown shanty.

The bartender stood in silence, then gave out a sign and turned to prepare him another glass, but not before nodding at him in disapproval.

“Thank you.” The young soldier figured that it was best to say little.

“HOHOHOOO. It looks like Christmas came early.” He smacked his lips before putting his hands on the young soldier’s shoulders to square them up. “Ahhhhhh, now this one is of my own flesh and mind, hehehehe. Good lie to keep his nose out of our business, Greg.” He slowly said, even though the bartender could hear him from a few steps away. But he couldn’t be bothered to confront the old fool.

“I am Kayn, sir .. uh, so about the thing you said about being that guy,-“

“Oh fuck that guy. I can’t even remember me being him. Probably because my life was so depressing I blew out whatever memory I had of him, when the barrel of my gun was sticking into my mouth.”

“So ... you are saying that you were him – like you lived his life. I mean I know it is a weird question, but ... I am sorry, I must be looking so weird that –“

The old soldier gave him a curious look as he dug his elbow into the table. “You are an early bloomer, aren’t you?” He asked with genuine curiosity.

“An early ... bloomer?”

“Ohohohohoho.” The old soldier chuckled to himself. “Oh, trust me you are gonna love the next 500 billion years.”

“I don’t understand.”

The bartender slammed his drink onto the counter.

“So when you die and you start living another life, it is only a matter of time before you forget your first life. And an early bloomer is someone who has yet to forget their first life. I don’t really remember but it was probably around the thousands when you start forgetting.” He revealed before downing the mug.

“God, now that was a good last one for them all.”

Kayn was aghast at such a revelation. The old soldier’s eyes went wide.

“Noooo, don’t tell me you thought you were the only one. I mean surely you would have noticed in your first couple of lives.” He toppled the mug to get the last few drops left.

“But this is only my second one.”

“No no no, that must be wrong. You can’t be the second. I may be old, but even I remember the first one, it was umm ... full of the flower and daisies.” He gestured with his hands.

“I was a slave in the desert. I died of starvation.” He shook his head, still in shock.

“Kid, the point is. I don’t blame you for not knowing. This time period is a bit kuku. With how the council of Monism has been strict about talking about past lives. It is a big taboo to even talk about the idea of being a different person. You don’t know what life you will end up, once they are off with your head.”

He warily looked to his surroundings for any eavesdroppers. But I was only them and the exhausted bartender who was whipping some glasses. “Like we are doing right now?”

“It is wartime, boy. People are too much on edge to risk revealing anything to the government, lest you want to be accused of being a Khazalist yourself.” He rubbed his eyes to sober up. “But there will be times when you will live through where none of this worrying matters. Where you are free to enjoy what you have, how you like it and you will know what the future holds, so you can’t have the piece of mind that it is not important how hard you fuck up. You are all there is, so treat yourself the best you can. That is how you can be sure that everyone else gets the best they deserve. But at the end of it all, nothing of this will matter.” He stretched his arms before standing up. “You serve a good Grog for a half swine. Send my love to your mother.” He bid farewell to the bartender as he took his leave.“

No, it was brought daylight. I couldn't have been but a five-minute walk from the road. I loved to come here at least once a week in the fall season when the trees are bright shades of red and orange. It felt magical to me in a way that nothing else did. It was my special place where I came to be alone.

But today there was another.

He was so close already that it was a miracle I hadn't noticed him sooner. He was tall, decently muscular, and wore denim jeans with a button-up flannel shirt. And it would have been unnerving enough if it weren't for the animal mask.

He wore a mask that covered his entire head. A deer mask that appeared to be real... and rotting. It had no eyes and its mouth hung open exposing its decaying teeth. I inhaled shakily and took a step back. The dead leaves crunched under my weight. It had to have been all the indication he needed to know I was about to flee.

He broke toward me in a full sprint, and I turned to run. But the fear coursing through me turned my legs to jelly and I couldn't seem to run properly. I could hear the leaves behind me making a racket under his feet as he closed in. I broke through my own head and pulled it together, forcing myself into a sprint.

I ran track dammit. I was faster than most of the other girls, even. I was uniquely prepared for this situation.

I pumped my arms and lifted my knees, moving faster and faster. I didn't need to look back to know he was right on my heels. I regulated my breathing and began to think more clearly. I couldn't afford to stop at my car. I would have to run straight down the road and flag someone down. I thanked my stars that I wore my running shoes today.

And then cursed them as I was tackled to the ground. I screamed and turned around to wrestle him off of me, but it was no good. He had to have been one of those MMA guys because he got me in a hold before I knew what was happening. His forearm was pressed hard against my throat. I struggled all that I could until the brightness around me turned dark... and I drifted away.

When I came to, I was being dragged by ankles. I found that my mouth had been taped shut and my hands and legs were bound by rope. The leaves rustled in my ears as I slid easily over them. The man in the deer mask was pulling me toward some kind of structure. I managed to lift my head enough to see that it was a shack in a small clearing.

It was like the horror movies after all. I began struggling with the ropes but it was no use. He dragged me into the darkness of the shack and lifted me with relative ease onto a long dining room table. I started screaming again in hopes that someone– anyone at all would come to my rescue. But it was all in vain. He closed the door, only the light from the shuttered windows illuminating the room.

He then moved to the couch and began messing with something out of view. I began hyperventilating as I looked for a way out. I had heard the door lock. The windows were poorly boarded. I was truly, truly fucked.

He approached with a radio in hand and set it down on one of the chairs next to the table. He turned it on and the busted speaker sputtered out some garbled pop music. He looked at me and then did something unexpected. He reached down and tore the tape off my mouth. I immediately began begging for my life as he placed his hands on the sides of the deer mask and lifted it off. All of my words died in my mouth.

""Oh, fuck,"" I muttered.

""That's right,"" she said as she stared back at me. ""Oh, fuck is right, Megan.""

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It wasn't a man– it was Beatrice Hanley, one of my classmates. I didn't need to think hard about the motive. I had been pretty terrible to her in the past.

""Beatrice...""

""Just shut up, Megan,"" she cut me off. ""You know how sick of your voice I am? I only took off the tape so I could hear your scream.""

""Beatrice, please,"" I said in a wavering tone. ""I- I'm sorry.""

""Sorry now,"" she said as she lifted a toolbox up from the floor and hefted it onto the table.

""Oh, shit, please,"" I begged. ""Please don't do this. I won't tell anyone!""

""I know you won't,"" she said cryptically as she popped the latches on the sides of the toolbox and opened it up.

""Oh, God, Please, Beatrice,"" I sobbed. ""Holy shit, please don’t do this.""

""I asked you nicely earlier in the year to leave me alone,"" she said as she rustled through the tools. ""You could have stopped fucking with me a long time ago, but you didn't.""

I let my head fall to the table as tears streamed down my cheeks. It made sense now. She had joined track when she first came to our school. She was insanely fast. Me and some of the other girls bullied her off of the team and she joined wrestling where she shined there too. Then we made fun of her for *that*.

""You've called me, oh let's see,"" she mused. ""Flat ass. Big nose. Big Bertha. But the one that really stuck was Manly Hanley. That was your finest work. And now you're about to be *my* finest work.""

""Beatrice, this isn't who you are,"" I cried.

""It wasn't,"" she said. ""For the past... I don't even know *how* many lifetimes, it wasn't. But I'm tired of being nice. Tired of dealing with bullshit. Tired of being responsible. I've been so many damn people, but I've never been one like this. So I'm doing this now.""

I looked down at her to see her staring back at me through dead eyes. Whatever she was on about, she believed it fully. I hadn't known that Beatrice was *legitimately* crazy.

""And right now, you're thinking I'm a crazy person,"" she said as she lifted a blow torch and tested it. ""It's funny, you know... I see crazy people on the street; on TV. And I always wondered, what drives someone to be like that?"" She set the blow torch on the table and leaned forward with a heavy sigh. ""And now I've realized it. It's me at the tail end of my journey. Self-destructive, uninhibited, fulfilling any desires that come to mind... it's just me after I've finally tipped. And I'm about to tip hard right now.""

""W-what the fuck are you *talking* about?"" I whimpered.

""Oh, nothing,"" she said with a calm smile as she pulled out a welding mask and fit it snuggly over her face. ""Nothing at all, ya dumb bitch.""

""Beatrice, please,"" I pleaded. ""Don't kill me.""

""Not gonna kill you,"" she said as he picked up the blowtorch. ""You're gonna *wish* you were dead. You'll have a lot of family support and therapy will help a ton, but you'll never really be whole again. You'll hate the sound of rustling leaves and the song on the radio right now will trigger you for the rest of your life, but more or less, you'll be alright.""

""... H-how d-""

""How do I know?"" she asked. ""Because I've been you too.""

When I first read the prompt, I immediately thought of ""The Egg,"" a short story written by Andy Weir. He is the guy who wrote "" The Martian"" and ""Artimis."" Those are great books and an awesome movie, but ""The Egg"" became a part of my soul the first time I read it. I just had to read it again. I googled ""The Egg"" and clicked on the familiar purple link for Galactanet.com/oneoff and felt the tingle in my spine when I read, ""You were on your way home when you died."" Of course, like any good Gen Xer, I read it in Morgan Freeman's voice. 


    

Morgan Freeman continued to read in my head, but something felt different. The story had the familiar pacing, and the reveal still gave me goose bumps, but it felt more visceral, more like the memory of seeing my daughters birth, or the moment I fell to my knees in the hotel parking lot after my wife told me my mother had died. I just sat there, Morgan Freeman repeating it over and over in my head, ""Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life"" ""Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”


    

After a minute or so, Morgan Freeman's voice just stopped. I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, looked at my dog, Todd, and said, ""OK, that was strange."" 


""Yup, that was an odd one."" He replied in Morgan Freeman's voice.


""What?"" I said, pushing my chair back from the desk.


    

""I have heard of this possibility, but have never seen it happen,"" Todd said as the room around me faded to the void.

    

""Seen what? What happened?"" I stammered.


""We are not positive, but there are two main ideas about how this happens."" Todd began.


""When we create a new soul, we use our own soul as a sort of template. It provides the basic foundations of the universe. Things like gravity, the speed of light, how an atom splits, and the other basic rules of the universe. One idea is that when a new soul is created, some of the knowledge of the first soul, knowledge beyond just the basics, is passed into it.""


Todd looked at me to make sure I was understanding.


""OK, that makes sense. But I still don't know *what* happened. Did I die? "" I asked.


""Not like all the other times. This time, you just sort of summoned me.""


""What does that mean?"" Growing frustration evident in my voice.


""It means you just appeared before me in the same way I appeared before you.""


'What kind of all knowing God doesn't know how they got here?"" I demanded.


""All knowing God is a label you put on me. God is the closest concept you have to understanding.""


""Fine, but I still don't know what is happening right now. I read 'The Egg'. Aren't you supposed to send me back to another body to live another life and grow my soul?"" I asked.

    

""I can't. That is what I am trying to explain. Your soul has finished.""


""Finished? What is finished?"" An odd mix of panic and excitement welling up in my chest.


""There are no more lives for you to live.""


""You mean I have matured? My egg is about to hatch?""


""Oh, no. An Egg, as you call it, doesn't hatch. When you have matured, you just move on. But since you are still here, there doesn't seem to be any extra knowledge in your template to accelerate maturity. No, this is something different."" Morpheus said with a slight hint of sadness.



""What's the other theory about what is happening?"" I asked. 


""These are not theories. A theory needs the backing of the scientific method. Calling them hypotheses would be slightly more accurate but still needs something to observe. We cannot observe another soul once it is created. Even talking to me right now is not actually happening in a void."" He said, waving his hand as the void became a dark dingy room with two red chairs. 

    

As Todd stood up, he transformed into Lawrence Fishburn as Morpheus and motioned for me to sit across from him. As I sat down, I could see my reflection in his glasses. I WAS NEO.


Morpheus laughed, recognizing what I saw. ""Yes, you will see me as you need to see me. You will see yourself as you need to see yourself.""


""I don't just see myself as Neo, I feel like I am Neo.""


""You are."" Morpheus replied. ""You wrote the Matrix. You played both Neo and Moepheus. You directed and edited the movie. You have written, directed, and starred in every movie you have ever seen. You created everything that exists here.""


""What about you? Did I create you?""


""Sort of. But honestly, you wouldn't understand anymore than Todd would understand how a cell phone works, "" he said as he reached down, petting Todd behind the ears.


""The second idea is that some souls destroy themselves.""


I gasped, ""I destroyed my soul?""


""Maybe. Some believe a soul can simply be corrupted. From the start. Or what you might call a bad egg.""


""Well, you created it. Fix my egg."" I demanded.


""I can't. This is your soul.""


""What do you mean you can't?"" I stood up as my knees wobbled. "" This is ridiculous. I didn't ask to have my soul be created in the first place. You decided for me and then stuck me in a corrupted soul."" My heart was racing, and my head was spinning as I sat back down, whispering, ""You are a terrible God,"" under my breath.


""I know this is scary, but are you really surprised? Look at what has become of your world. It is all you. You did this. This reality is what you made. Every evil in existence is you. You are responsible for it all.""


""You're right. I did this to my egg, my soul.""


I don't know how long I sat there feeling what I had done. Reliving every evil I had perpetrated on the innocent versions of me, struggling with how that part of me can exist. I deserve eternity in the void. I am evil.


""Without evil, there is no good,"" morpheus said.


""What? How did you know what I was thinking?""


""I long for the time you finally understand. We are in a room in the Matrix petting your dog, and you are surprised I know your thoughts?"" I felt him say.


""I guess."" I couldn't think of anything else to say, so I asked, ""What happens to a corrupted soul?""


""Our thought is It just continues to exist. You will begin to regain all the memories of all your lives, but your egg will never hatch, "" He said sadly.


""Wait, so I just stay here in this void?""


""I honestly don't know. I have never seen this happen before.""


""You've never seen this? How many souls have you created?"" I asked.


""Just one."" He smiled.


""I'm the only one you ever created?""


""No, I am the only one I have ever created. You are my memory.""


""Memory, what does that even mean?"" Fear escaping through my voice.


""After a soul has matured, or the egg has hatched if you will, it can relive any part of its existence. We can make small changes and see what might have happened. In my soul, humans don't exist. Earth does, but a wholly separate species evolved.""


""HOLD ON!"" I shouted, standing up. ""Humans don't exist?"" 


""That is the fascinating part."" He seemed excited now.

""Humans only exist in my memory. All of the existence you know is what my memories evolved into when I wanted to see what would happen if I only seeded a single planet. I had no idea you guys would figure it out. You can't imagine what I felt when you first created The Matrix. You were so close. The flat earthers, even the idea of heaven and hell, are all my soul screaming for confirmation of what I know to be true. Then you wrote 'The Egg'. I mean, come on. You nailed it.""


""If I am a memory of your soul, don't you mean we nailed it?"" I asked.


A broad smile crossed his face, ""Now you are beginning to understand.""


I smiled back. ""Ok then, how do we make humans real?"" I asked.


""Do you feel real?"" Morpheus asked as the room faded to black.",16,wapu,2023-06-23 12:58:47

I was driving myself and my buddy Chuck to work, just as I had done countless days before. We were waiting at a red light, as Chuck suddenly exclaimed: ""Wait a minute, I remember that! It's today?!"". The light turned green and I started to drive, while giving him a quizzical side-glance. But before I could ask him what the hell he was talking about, a loud honking noise came from my right, and then everything turned black.

I found myself in a dimly lit room that seemed to go on infinitely in every direction. Close to the ground, fog was swirling, as if the entire floor was made out of dry ice. Just ahead of me, a large world map was tacked to a wooden pinboard. Next to it, on a small table, there was an analogue clock with a built-in display of the current date. Between the pinboard and the table, a pole was sticking up from the ground, with a note attached to it on eye-level: ""Pick a time and place."" Underneath there was a big red button.

It started to dawn on me what this was. After a moment of thought, I fished a pin-prick off the side of the pinboard and stuck it into the spot where London was indicated on the map. Then I picked up the clock/calender and set it to a date in the late 15-hundreds. I always loved the theather and figured it would be wonderful to see some of the original performances of Shakespeares plays. I briefly contemplated if that was really what I wanted, but then just said ""screw it"" and punched the button. I never was one that delved too long on important questions. Everything turned white, and I came too in the arms of a giant, tired-looking woman who gave me a loving smile.

Of course I realized later she wasn't actually giant, I was just a baby. I had indeed been reborn at the time and place I specified, but still retained all my memories to my previous live in the 20th century. Although the memories always felt more like a story I have been told at one point, nudging at the back of my mind, instead of something that had actually happened to me. My second life was a good one, albeit much less comfortable than the first. I managed to watch the premiere of Romeo and Juliet, and the reaction of the crowd is still one of my favourite memories. What did me in the second time was the common flu; poor access to medicine has always been one of the downsides of picking a time too early in history.

I kept returning countles times to the strange room with the clock/calendar and the map, to which I added an increasingly impossible amount of pin-pricks. I lived lives at the earliest dawn of civilization and in utopian and dystopian worlds my original self would have considered the distant future. At first, I was ever hungry to experience something new, but after a while I started returning to times and places of lives I had previously lived. The first time I ran into myself was surprisingly mundane: I was currrently living in the 42nd century and took a weekend trip to Mars. It came to me that I had previously worked as a flight attendant on a ship just like the one I was on at that moment, when I saw her walking past me with that odd, odd green-blue ckeckered hair, which was the fashion of the time: Zoozyy, one of my many, many previous lives.

It was a weird experience for me and I had this irrational fear of creating a weird time-paradox, so I avoided her as best I could and got off the ship as fast as possible, once we landed at the Olympus Mons Port. After that it happened again ever so often, with an increasing frequency as my amount of lives increased, and the surface of the magic map in the ""in-between"", as I started calling it, started to become a solid layer of pin-prick heads. After a while, I became a bit more comfortable with the idea and even started to befriend my previous selves. Of course Chuck, the buddy that shared my very first death, turned out to also have been me.

As I lost track of the number of times I had died myself, I turned somewhat jaded for a while. If I got lucky and was born in a position of privilige, I tended to exploited the situation without remorse, showing little care for others who were less fortunate, even though I new some of them were in fact actually me. Not ""some"", actually. ""A lot"" as I realized more and more. When the number of lives I had lived was well into the millions, I started to see a faint shimmer around people who were previous incarnations of me. After millions of more lives, that shimmer had become more distinct, and eventually I could see connections spanning between all of them. Approaching my first billion, walking through a crowd became a very strange experience. It was as if swimming through a sea of light as a significant portion showed a distinct yellow glow, indicating that that person was a previous incarnation of mine. Surprisingly enough, I could clearly remember each and every one of them.

The horrifying realization dawned on me very late, after having decided to pay London of the 16th century another visit, as I had done millions of times before at that point. I had looked forward to revisiting the plays of Shakespeare again, which still held a special place in my heart, so it was quite a shock when my baby ears heard that *my* new name was William Shakespeare! In all my countless previous lives, I had never become an actual historical figure, and now I couldn't ignore the feeling anymore, that had been gnawing at the back of my mind for a while now: There is no-one but me! Everyone is just another incarnation of myself. If I don't remember some, and don't see the yellow glow around them, that just means they lie in my personal future! If I'm even freaking William Shakespeare, it must be so!

Something in my newborn William Shakespeare Baby mind shifted, and every person that didn't previously have the yellow glow that marked them as one of my past selves started to glow in a fade blue. As with the yellow light, also the blue one contributed to a spider-web of light spanning between literally every person ion the world. And not just every person living at that moment in time, in the 16th century. Somehow I suddenly could also see connections spanning forward and backward in time. The lights grew, and merged, and suddenly I was completely encompassed by it.

""So it finally happened, eh?"" a booming voice all around and inside me said, as I floated in an endless void of white. ""Who are you? What is happening?"" I cried out, even though I was still a baby that shouldn't actually be able to talk yet. ""I am the Creator of this world. God, if you want. And, as you have realized by now, I am you."" the voice said gravely. ""I don't know how I came to be. As far as I can tell, I have always existed. I have always been this empty Void of Nothing, all on My own. As the eons passed, I realized I had the power to create worlds inside Me. That amused Me for a while, but what I really wanted was companionship. That, however, was something I never was able to create."" As it revealed this to me, the voice was submersed in a deep, profound sorrow that all but overwhelmed my little mortal heart.

""To end My loneliness at least for a brief while,"" the voice continued ""I finally decided upon a somewhat drastic measure: I split Myself in many tiny aspects and scattered them all over a new world I had created. Making each of them forget about the whole that is Me. Living out their incredibly short lives enjoying the company of all the other parts of Me, they don't realize they are also a part of.""

""Except now I actually do realize it."" I said. Slowly. Accepting the truth of what the voice had told me. ""I guess I've been too many parts of You already, to not realize what I am.""

My mind shifted again, and suddenly I *was* the Voice. The world and all the incarnations -- fragments -- of Myself where still there, but now I saw it for what it was, just a part of me, nothing separate. It didn't change anything. What else was there to do, but to ignore this uncomfortable truth? All I could do was to play pretend and enjoy the company of all the other tiny fragments of myself, to avoid the eternal loneliness for what I now perceived as only a brief amount of time.

I willed myself to shut off the connection to My larger Self as best as I could and resumed my mortal lives. I enjoyed my life as William Shakespeare, and all the others that followed. I kept on going from live to live, putting pin after pin in my magic world map until there was no more live I could go to. I had experienced every live from the first hominids to the last Humans clawing at live in their failling generation ships, trying to flee the solar system as it was consumed by the Sun becoming a red giant.

And now that it is all done, I'll create a new world and start the whole process over gain. After all, what else is there to do?",8,RookJameson,2023-06-23 13:01:03

In order to talk to him, you become a villain.",,13476,2023-11-17 15:15:28,k9pqnoi,"Most cops worship at the altar of The Shriek, and those of us who don't are careful to keep it to ourselves. Don't get me wrong, if they had to, they'd arrest him on sight. That is, while on sight of people bound to make a fuss if they see an LEO asking him for his autograph.  

The few cops who don't like him are the ones who still believe in human rights and due process, and in not secretly celebrating when burglars are found impaled on traffic lights.  

Me, I don't like him because of that and because he's my father.  

A few years back I made the mistake of taking one of those 46 And Counting tests and I came up related to DNA found at crime scenes. Then someone from the Union approached me quietly to tell me who that DNA belonged to and why, surely, as a cop, I would agree it was better to keep it all discreet. I agreed, out of shame.  

I never met my mother, grew up in the system. And after it became known through gossip who my father was, I had to -also discreetly- beat up a couple guys. See, there was a betting pool on who my mother may be, with three of the sexiest former costumed criminals as the favorites. And the questions about whether I remembered “coming out of there” got to be too much.  

Growing in the system, they say, has a way of twisting you. Me, it gave me an obsession with bullies, particularly righteous bullies. That's why I became a cop. That's why I can't stand vigilantes. All they are is assholes with a fondness for violence, who found an acceptable target. I do see the irony, I want to squash that irony.  

I shouldn't be in pursuit right now. The orders may be to capture The Shriek, but status quo is to not run too fast and find something else with which to get busy. It's not just that The Shriek is scary, it's that he “cleans the city” the way the force wish they could, were it not for all those damn human rights and laws and freedoms. If it wasn't for this need to bring the bastard in, I'd have quit by now.  

I run up the rundown stairs. This building is what cops call a nest. The tenants, what they call vermin. A Shriek feeding ground. When there aren't big time criminals doing something out there, when it's hard to even find shoplifters, he comes here to beat up a few junkies.  

A kid looks at me through a half open door. He looks dirty. Probably parents who have fallen too deep into despair to even remember they have a child. I make a mental note to call a social worker I know, if I make it through the night.  

There's screaming coming down the stairs. Some of warning, some of delirium, some of fear and pain. And when I make it to the top there's the sickening sound of fists on flesh. Whoever's getting the Shriek Special is not able to scream or grunt anymore.  

The door is wide open and I run in. There's two pulps down already, hopefully dead for mercy's sake, and The Shriek is working up a third.  

The vigilante’s costume has changed through the years, and these days he wears a flat black faceplate, spray painted with bright yellow thorns. The same pattern repeats all through his body armor, which gives the impression of nothing but sharp edges.  

The face plate turns to me and his voice comes out of a speaker, thick and menacing.  

“I got this one, officer”.  

I wonder what's under the plate. I am curious if it would be an older version of my own face looking back.  

I grab my gun and aim.  

“On the ground, hands behind your head!” I order.  

The Shriek tilts his head, uncomprehending.  

I recite the main charges for which he's wanted and repeat the command to get on the ground.  

And he gets it. Instantly. There's no witnesses forcing me to pretend I care about his extrajudicial acts.  

The Shriek drops the bleeding mess he was tenderizing and squares up, intimidating me with his frame and the armor on top of it.  

“Wanna dance, *muchacho*?” The heavily accented and mocking way he says ‘muchacho’ throws me for a loop. I know I'm half white and that he's that half, but I didn't see coming he'd be that shade of white.  

I repeat the command to get on the ground, hands behind his head.  

“What, I fucked up one of your *vatos*?” His armored gloves creak as he tightens his fists. For an instant I wonder what it would've been like to grow up under those fists instead of the foster ones.  

What the hell am I doing? This thing, this nightmare has lived dealing violence longer than I've existed. Am I really expecting to zip tie his armored wrists and walk him down to my car? Drive him to the station? Show everybody there that I got their hero?  

“Your move, *holmes*” He says, like reading my mind.  

I can already see the story. Corrupt cop killed by The Shriek. Commissioner states vigilantism still unacceptable.  

I came here with an obsessive intention, to capture The Shriek. I also came here with a non-regulation gun I took from the evidence room. Specially designed, gun and bullets, to pierce The Shriek’s body armor. We got it from a weapons dealer with a grudge and really shitty tax evading practices. I told myself it was only for a desperate situation, but I hadn't wanted to see that it was desperate from the get go.  

I repeat the command, count to ten, then I shoot.  

One of the bullets went through the face plate, cracking it. The rest also delivered, going clean through his center of mass.  

I can't help myself. With shaking hands I pull off his face plate. I don't know what I was expecting. I guess if you look long enough you could say I look like him. I have his nose, but softer. I have his eyes but wider apart. I don't have the hole on his right cheek where the bullet went in.  

Everything dawns on me all at once and I throw up right besides The Shriek's corpse. There goes a bunch of evidence. But who cares at this point? I went down the path to becoming him before I knew I was doing it. I wonder if he'd be proud now.  

I walk down the stairs hearing whispering, people beginning to wonder what the fuck happened, if The Shriek had his full and went home, and they can come out of hiding.  

Outside the building I remember to call that social worker. More evidence linking me to this mess.  

I drive to a few blocks from my place and drop the patrol car. Walk the rest of the way, get a bag and the few things I need or care about, get in my personal car and drive away. There will be a price on my head in this city before the sun comes up, but it won't be the criminal element setting it.

The driver checked his watch and turned down the radio as his passengers climbed out, their boots thudding against rain-slick cement.

“Three minutes,” he drawled – he didn’t wait for confirmation before he turned the radio back up, drumming his fingertips against the steering wheel.

The song ended and a new one started, a growled rock-and-roll ballad – his fingers thudded against the wheel faster and faster, synchronized with a frenetic drumline, drowning out the sounds of breaking glass and gunfire. When a distant scream cut through the song, he grimaced and turned it up a few notches further.

Inside, a security guard with blood smeared across his face looked up at the criminal who struck him – his eyes are filled with an expression between terror and disbelief, the vacant grasping gaze of a man whose day has suddenly deviated from its planned course in the most catastrophic way possible.

“Don’t try to get back up, and you won’t get hurt again,” said a voice from across the bank – a voice rendered into booming static by a modulator, the same way that the speaker’s face was obscured by a metallic black mask resembling the head of a koala bear - it  hooked into the collar of sleek powered armor, leaving not an inch of flesh exposed. “I’m sure you don’t get paid enough.”

The security guard looked at the other civilians in the bank – saw his own fear mirrored in their eyes – and thought about telling the supervillain running the robbery that his job wasn’t about the money. It was about keeping the peace – about making sure that no one ever had to feel like he felt now. He shook his head – they wouldn’t understand.

“Good lad,” said Drop Bear II – Sydney’s most renowned supervillain, a criminal who had stolen the name of a retired hero and now used his hyper-advanced armor to commit flashy heists across the city. “How are we doing on time, Mick?”

“Ninety seconds,” said one of the goons, checking his watch – they were among the most loyal henchmen in Oceania, and for good reason. They got vision and dental insurance, and there was no ninety-day probationary period.

Drop Bear II nodded, lifted his arm – the composition of the gauntlet around one fist went liquid, amorphous, changing shape, and the proton cannon that formed from the unstable nanites shredded through the wall of the bank with enough force left over to leave the vault door warped. His henchmen stormed through the breach and started throwing stacks of wrapped bills into their bags – their boss reclined against one of the banker’s desks, looking oddly at ease.

“Hurry up!” The criminal called Mick shouted – the group of bank robbers trotted back through the lobby with their backs bent under the weight of fully-loaded duffel bags and, approaching a car parked at the curb, loaded in. The security guard heard tires screech as they pulled away.

Drop Bear II stayed where he was – the civilians could hear him counting down under his breath.

“Five ... four ... three ... ah, he’s early.” Then the wall exploded, and as everyone nearby dove for cover, a great grey shape moved through the room like a wrecking ball – there was a scent like ozone as the proton cannon discharged again, and again, and now they could see Drop Bear II flinching backwards, his arms raised, fending off a shape that leapt and roared and slashed massive claws ...

“It’s the Drop Bear!” shouted one of the tellers. “You’re in for it now, imposter!”

The duo broke apart, skidding in opposite directions – the Drop Bear hit a desk and destroyed it with his raw bulk whilst the supervillain slid gracefully to the far wall.

“Get out of here,” growled the Drop Bear – no one waited for him to repeat himself. As heroic as the Drop Bear was, his appearance – the result of radiation inflicted decades prior at a zoological exhibit – struck fear as well as any villain. He hulked over everyone else in the bank, a mountain of grey fur, a koala bear with the mass of a silverback gorilla. The civilians scattered, leaving hero and villain alone in the ruins of the lobby.

A moment of silence passed between them before the villain spoke.

“I knew it,” even through the modulator, his awe was obvious. “I knew that you would come.”

“I’ll never be too retired to beat on somebody who uses my name for evil,” said the elder Drop Bear. “Why didn’t you leave with your goons?”

“I ... wanted to see you,” came the words, spoken haltingly. “I didn’t know how to find you.”

“Eh?” Deep-set koala eyes narrowed. “What are you, captain of the fan club?”

Outside, police formed rigid defensive lines and aimed their long-guns through the wall of the bank – Drop Bear II could feel his suit’s reactive defenses priming to deflect the incoming bullets, but it was hard to focus with his heart pounding against his ribs.

“I just wanted to know if it was worth it,” the villain said, voice low. “To be a hero.”

“Worth it? Kid, my book about controlling your inner animal was featured in Oprah’s book club. They sell Drop Bear’s Famous Meat Pies from Canberra to Chicago. It’s a small price to pay, havin’ to beat someone unconscious when they step out of line.”

“But you never had a family,” The supervillain shook his head. “Didn’t you feel lonely?”

“How would you know?” The hulking hero bared a mouthful of teeth that could cut through bone as easily as bamboo. “Who are you, kid?”

There was a distant boom – backup coming from across the Outback, fliers en route. The hero flinched, his sensitive ears taking the sonic wave like a physical blow – and in that moment, the villain activated the thrusters in his boots, propelling himself upwards towards the ceiling.

Drop Bear bent his knees and leapt, realizing too late that he would be an easy target in midair – he cursed himself as he saw the proton cannon start to swing around, cursed the years spent in retirement sitting at a desk with a tie fastened around his fuzzy neck. His dead friends were going to laugh at him when he saw them.

But instead, the cannon kept revolving, swung until it aimed towards the ceiling above – it fired, blowing a hole in the rooftop, and Drop Bear II lifted out of the bank to hover above. A dozen rifles fired and scattered their rounds across a glittering force-field.

“Damn it, I asked you a question!” Drop Bear shouted. “Who are you!?”

The modulator clicked off and the supervillain laughed, a mirthless laugh that was somehow familiar – it reminded the Drop Bear of someone he hadn’t seen in twenty years. He could see her face, distinct in his mind, as the villain accelerated away from the building.

A few moments later, Osprey and the rest of the Skywardens descended around the bank – Drop Bear walked out through the shattered wall, shaking his head.

“Who the heck was that?” Osprey demanded – Drop Bear bit back his typical aggression and tried to remember that this new wave of heroes was gentler than his old friends. When he spoke, it was in a low rumble.

What annoyed me was the storm that he flew through.  My eyes were shut so tight, they nearly froze going through the clouds.  My cybernetic ear implants continued to buzz in my ear, blocking out moisture and the speed of the wind, the only remaining comfort I had.

The mechanical prototype suit had been shredded, and the leather harness that strapped me to the protective roll cage had produced less than adequate results. Something to reinforce to confor-


The air got warmer as we dropped below the clouds, the overcast sky becoming more grey as we descended.  I smiled and blinked to get the wetness out of my eyes. *I must get ahead of myself and install the new implants to avoid this discomfort.  Setting me down gently in a small steel cage, the man that I came to know as my Father found his own spot. Roughly ten paces away, a small chamber rose from the ground, the grass dead from the constant use.  A mini-fridge appeared.


""Still drinking the blue flavour? That's my favourite.""


His silent continued as he chugged a bottle of it. Then another.  I fidgetted to scratch an irritation in my back before he turned to me. ""You're going to jail. For good.""


I smiled. ""Nice to see you too Robert Lang.""  He scowled, then narrowed his eyes. 


""How do you know that name.""  He growled as he walked closer, hard steps kicking up sand. I continued to smile.


""Birth certificate. Mum gave it to me when I was ten. You remember Becca, right?""  My teeth, polished only yesterday by my dentist, gleaned white in the sun.  ""She's still practicing you know.""


His face turned scarlet. ""What kind of trick is this?!""  He ripped the steel bars apart and picked me up by what was left of my collar. ""Who are you?""


""Your son.""

He looked at me, deep into the sockets of my eyes. He softened. His grip loosened, and dropped me to the floor. His eyes were thoughtful, tracing back the numerous flings, vacation romances, the by-gones and the smooches on the cheeks, the moments of peace and solitude.  You could hardly blame him. Moving from one moment to the next, from one villain to the next.  His eyes rose to meet mine again.


""Another one. Again. Huh.""  He stepped back to give me space again, and looked over me.  ""You became this to what, talk to me?""


I stood, uneasily as my left hip's pain rose sharply with the movement.  There was likely a rib fracture as it hurt somewhat to breath on that side. Maybe a strain? I must re-eva-


""What kind of kid goes through the effort of inventing a mecha suit to destroy a city?""  He interupted my thought.


I chuckled softly, softly enough for my chest to rest easy. ""One that demands attention from my Father I guess?""  He smirked at that briefly.


He sighed, waving me to follow him.  The mini-fridge rose again to the surface.  Handing me one of the bottles, he stated, ""You're still going to jail.""",789,imakhink,2023-11-17 17:11:50

The hero walks in through the hole he made in the wall, each step confident yet cautious of unknown dangers. He uses his enhanced vision to scan through the lingering smoke and dimness.  There are toys and diapers and baby bottles blown around. Confusion strikes the hero first then anger. 

""What kind of villain would harm a baby?!"" he yells with genuine fury. 

As if triggered like a gun, a deep chuckle rises from across the room where even the moon light refuses to touch. 

""Villain?"" The deep voice slowly nears the hero. What was that odd rattling sound? ""Aren't you the villain here for trespassing on private property?"" 

The hero takes a defensive stance and awaits for the villain to reveal himself. Since his intelligence team could only pick up the familiar ominous calling card from their scanners, he knew he had to approach the situation carefully or risk tearing a family apart so soon. He prioritizes rescuing the child first (possibly any other hostages since this villain could've kidnapped the rest of this family to slow him down) and, if the fight gets to dangerous for the baby, a quick escape to the closest safe house. 

As the hero was devising his plan, he missed how the outline of the shadowy figure was... short. Like super short. 

Another chuckle rose deep from the villain. ""Aren't you also a villain for abandoning a family in the guise of the 'greater good'?"" 

An infant dressed in a black onesie with a short red cape waddled out into the light in a blue and black... baby walker? ""Tonight shall be the last night you ever leave this family again!"" 

As the vil- baby maniacally laughed, the door to the room slammed wide open. A woman with braided red hair and mismatching clothes (is that spit up on her shirt?) barges in, shrieking, ""Jacob Amy Ramos, Jr.! You better NOT be in here making explosives again!""

Jamal thinks, 'He says something that makes his amulet glow and then it's like the world around him glitches to do... something. Usually stuff that benefits him. I need to find his power. Then I can make it my own...and he'll see me.'

Jamal sets his eyes back on the street, everything is going according to plan so far. He has a friend across town who has a very useful power right now. She can control radio waves, and with the right setup, she is now tricking all police to head towards the opposite side of town. It's a classic setup really, if you want a hero to show, make sure they're needed.

""Right on time!"" 

Jamal watches as his dad lands on the roof with a gentle and almost cloud like grace, the glow from the amulet around his neck quickly fading.

Jamal began to approach his father, ""I knew you'd come, and it's time you listened.""

His dad, the local hero known as Hexing, wasted no time in rushing towards his unbeknownst to him son. He grabbed his shirt and quickly dangled him off the ledge of the building with a strength that his body shouldn't be capable of. 

Hexing then stares into his son's eyes and makes his demanding questions, ""What is your plan? What have you done?!"" 

Jamal smiles and reaches his hand out towards his father's shoulder, carful not to let his eyes wander towards the amulet his father always wears.

""Mr. Hexing...or might I say Kobi Shepard?"" 

Jamal's smile turns into a devilish smirk as he sees the visage his father puts on as a hero vanishes. Jamal then watches as the amulet around his father's neck glows like before as he speaks some strange archaic language.

But, as his father's muscles tense up to throw his son back onto the roof, Jamal snatches the glowing amulet from his father's neck and rips it free.

Suddenly, his father loses his strength and collapses as his son, who was dangling over the ledge of the building falls.

Jamal smiles as he falls. The building is tall, but the fall is mere seconds. Shouting to the amulet in his hand, he recites the same words he's heard his father speak to it, the words Jamal has spent hours memorizing over recordings of his father's battles.

Suddenly, the amulet glows as it recognizes the voice of it's new master. Jamal's fall ceases and he simply floats there. It feels like he's being cradled in a massive and invisible hand. He then looks up towards the top of the building as his father looks down in disbelief.

Jamal flies back up the building to his dad as he stands atop the invisible force that lifts him.

""H-how? The amulet...it requires someone of blood relation. But you can't-""

Jamal laughs, his outburst interrupting his fathers disbelief. 

""Really?! Do you think that it's so impossible? That your youth would never catch up to you? Welcome to the real world, Dad! Your actions have consequences...and just like you made me live without something, I'm going to make you suffer the same!""

Jamal then flies closer to his father as he can tease him with a whisper, making sure to stay just out of arms reach. 

""The look on your face. You can hardly believe it yet the proof is right in front of you. I'm surprised you didn't see it before, but then again, nature versus nurture, right? I was forced to become stronger than you, and now you'll get to see that in full. So, about me taking something from you...this amulet is mine now. But don't you worry, I'm not just taking something from you, I'm also giving you something. You have a son now~""

Jamal's smile is wide and eyes crazed as he points his father's gaze to a nearby holoboard (holographic billboard used on building in the city). On the board is an article (created by Jamal's friend with the radio control) that is just being released saying not only that Hexing's true identity is Kobi Shepard, but that his son is Jamal Shepard, the new villain who's named himself Gozer.",377,--Socks--,2023-11-17 16:38:56

""Kid, if it were me I'd have kicked them back out on the street already. This guy was way too keen on pressing his luck though. Obviously wanted to be here, weirdly enough..."" The gruff older cop responded, clearly more exasperated by the circumstance than anything else.

It did not help that for some reason the local superhero, Obelisk, had taken a sudden interest in a crime such as this. The two officers stood with trepidation as they entered the lobby of the precinct and greeted the waiting hero.

""I hope I'm not impeding your work."" Obelisk offered in a deep stoic tenor.

The older cop simply waved the notion away with a dismissive hand. ""No, no. just paperwork day in and out for me any ways, your per is this way.""

The officers led the imposing figure of a hero back down the hall they had just left drop, retracing their steps back to the interrogation room. No sooner had the superhero entered the room than the older cop turned to leave.

""Where you going?"" The younger cop asked with a clear tone of confusion, his head flipping between the door to the observation room and back to his coworker.

""I couldn't be paid to care, if anything does come of that conversation, I can't imagine it being related to any case I'd touch with a ten foot pole if a super is involved."" Is all the older cop gave as he continued his retreat towards the break room.

The younger cop gave one last glance at the observation room door, his eyes lingering on it as his curiosity hung in the air. He eventually let out a sigh as he turned to head to the break room as well.

Inside the dim interrogation room the atmosphere was different. Tense. Obelisk stood over the criminal with an unreadable stare from beneath the obfuscating mask, his muscular arms braced against the table as if he were about to squash it like an accordion. The perp sat in the chair with a glare of his own, smugly defiant in the face of just an imposing presence.

The silence lingered for far too long as the two stared each other down. It was just one word that eventually broke the silence.

""Really.""

An eyebrow raised on the criminal, a smug grin forming across their face.

""Yeah?""

""Really.""

""Yeah, really.""

The threatening posture of Obelisk melted into a slump as he continued staring, a hand moving up to massage his face.

""Glenn, you know you could have just called me."" Obelisk says with a heavy dose of frustration.

""Oh, really?"" The criminal retorts with a snap. ""Check your damn phone old man! Who do you think I sent my call to? Figure it's only after the cops contacted you did you set *this* up.""

The perp leaned back in his chair, kicking his feet up onto the table.

""I know my work can keep me busy often, but you know better than this Glenn. I raised you better than this.""

""Your maid raised me better than this.""

An audible crick can be heard from the table as Obelisk's hand clutches it tightly, the snapping of the wood surface in his grasp causing amusement to play across the criminal's face.

""Look, can we talk about this later at home? I have to track down a lead and-"" Obelisk begins to ask tensely, his weighty tenor laced with an unsteady warble. The criminal cuts the superhero off however, letting out a long ""PFFF!"" as he drops his feet off the table and lets the chair slam back forward.

""Later! It's always later! What's it gonna take for it to be now!"" He shouts out at Obelisk, sending the hero into a backpedal.

""Look son, I really have to-""

""Yeah I get it. The lives of strangers matters more than your son.""

""...Look Glenn, I know it's tough with me not being around too often, but what I do is important. Don't throw your life away over this. What I do is really important and there are many people's lives I have to look out for.""

The air of strength seemed to have drained from Obelisk as he now stood, looking towards the estranged perp glaring at him from the table. The criminal in turn stood defiantly.

""Fine! Go do whatever you gotta. You know were I'll be? HERE! Because it's the only place in the world where you've given me the time of day. If I gotta be a criminal just for you to give me a second thought, then it doesn't matter how much gum it takes!""

It wasn't until recently that the truth, like a bolt of lightning, struck me with an intensity I never anticipated.  
  
The man I had known as my father was not my true progenitor. In a twist that seemed straight out of a surreal novel, I stumbled upon the revelation that my biological father was none other than a celebrated crime-fighter, a guardian of justice who sacrificed his personal life for the greater good. A flurry of emotions swept over me—awe, disbelief, and an inexplicable longing to connect with this enigmatic figure who had been absent from my life.  
  
But the irony was palpable; he didn't know I existed, and his life was consumed by his tireless pursuit of justice, leaving no room for personal connections. Desperate to bridge the chasm between us, I made a choice that shook me to the core—I became a villain.  
  
It was a role I never envisioned myself playing, yet the desire to establish contact with the man who unknowingly sired me eclipsed any moral qualms. I donned a facade, a persona veiled in darkness, weaving a web of chaos and crime to catch his attention.  
  
Every nefarious deed I committed weighed heavily on my conscience. The paradox of seeking a connection through actions diametrically opposed to everything he stood for gnawed at me relentlessly. Guilt and turmoil intertwined within, a storm raging in the very core of my being.  
  
Yet, with each orchestrated act, I edged closer to the inevitable confrontation, to the elusive chance of finally meeting him, of speaking words that carried the weight of a lifetime of yearning.  
  
The dichotomy of my emotions was crushing—anguish at the deceit I perpetuated, coupled with the anticipation of a reunion that held the promise of completeness.  
  
As I treaded this treacherous path, veering between the shadows of villainy and the flicker of hope for reconciliation, I grappled with the paradox of seeking connection through discord, a heart torn between two irreconcilable worlds.",50,Ithinkimdepresseddd,2023-11-17 17:32:45

ALL THIS TIME.

all.

This... entire time.

He was out there. Saving lives.

But... I needed him. He was stopping a building from falling, but where was he when I had to deal with my girlfriend cheating on me!

He can stop a bullet train from careening off its tracks but he can't pick me up from soccer? I waited for 3 hours!

He's... he's saving the world from a meteor! But he can't. He can't. He can't.... he just can't tell me happy birthday. Not even in a text.

I just... just a word.

Something. Anything.

He has so much time. So much everything. For everyone! For anyone!

But.... me.

I felt a fire inside me. Burning not with the rage I felt for years, but different. Something close to indifference, but colder, harsher.

Angry.

I... I think I didn't care about humanity. It truly didn't matter to me. I saw the news of my father saving a child from a robber and all I could think was... ""so what?""... ""so... what?"".

One more corpse delayed.

He cared about humanity. He cared so much.

Well, I don't?

 I don't.

In fact.... FUCK Humanity!

What good have they ever done?

They kill each other, hurt each other, forget each other! They barely care at all! All they do is hurt each other and they barely care! Humanity can go FUCK itself!

You know what. I can do that. I can force them to danger, force them to reconcile their little differences. Force them to suffer sooner rather than later.

He'd care then. Care about his little humanity. Care about all the little people who don't matter. Care about all the ones he has more time for.

I grabbed a cloak and added the clasp.

I had the power.

I felt it burning inside me.

Burning to BURN the world.

I let it go and it felt like... like water rushing off of me. Like my muscles relaxing for the first time in decades.

The world around me seemed to glow, beautiful reds and oranges I'd never seen. So... gorgeous. Unique. True.

It felt... right.

I felt the heat rise in the building. Felt the alarms start to blare and melt and silence. Oh, it felt... so RIGHT!

To feel like this all the time!

Well...

Well maybe dad didn t have time for his KID. 

But he'll care about the Monarch of Magma.

The Forever Flame. The Coal Maker.

The Eternal Fire.

I am... I AM THE ETERNAL FIRE. 

And I'll burn everything down.

Among the sea of faces, James Mitchell felt lost, searching for something that had been missing his entire life. His mother had kept the secret hidden well, but a mysterious letter left behind after her passing unveiled a truth he could never have imagined.  


  
His father, a man James had never known, was not the ordinary businessman he had been told. Instead, he was a crime-fighter, a vigilante working in the shadows to protect the city. James was torn between the desire to know his father and the fear of disrupting the dangerous life he led.  


  
Unable to contact his father directly, James concocted a plan. He decided to enter the world his father inhabited, but from the other side – as a villain. He spent weeks crafting a disguise and adopting a sinister persona, blending into the criminal underworld that his father fought against.  


  
As the mysterious new villain known as Shadowfall, James began to make a name for himself. He committed small crimes, leaving clues and messages for the city's hero. The local media buzzed with speculation about the enigmatic villain, capturing the attention of the city's residents.  


  
Unbeknownst to James, his father, Richard Steele, was becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of this new adversary. Night after night, Richard patrolled the city, trying to anticipate Shadowfall's next move. He was unaware that his own son was orchestrating the chaos he was desperately trying to prevent.  


  
The city became a battleground between father and son, each unaware of the other's identity. James struggled with the guilt of deceiving the man he longed to know, but he was determined to make contact and reveal the truth.  


  
One fateful night, as the city slept beneath a blanket of stars, the inevitable confrontation occurred. Shadowfall lured Richard into a dark alley, away from prying eyes. The two faced each other, masked and cloaked in shadows.  


  
""I've been watching you, hero,"" Shadowfall hissed, the disguised voice masking any hint of familiarity.  


  
Richard, undeterred, replied, ""You won't escape justice. The city deserves better.""  


  
In the heat of the confrontation, a realization dawned on Richard. He recognized the cadence of Shadowfall's voice, a familiarity that sent shivers down his spine. As the mask was torn away, father and son stared at each other in disbelief.  


  
""You... you're my son?"" Richard whispered, the revelation hitting him like a tidal wave.  


  
James nodded, the weight of his deception hanging heavy in the air. The father and son stood in the alley, the city's sounds echoing around them, as they grappled with the truth that had finally come to light.",17,Alone-Chard-8061,2023-11-17 18:40:17

He had gathered both the clients and the tellers of the bank and lined them up against the street facing windows, looking outside. He had to be sure the police wouldn't shoot at him. 

""He'll be here."" Sam said, trying to reassure himself. One hostage could leave for every minute he got to talk to Senior Detective Carl Weiss, Sam's father. That was the deal he made on the phone. He heard the cruisers pull up outside, establishing a perimeter. 

Time to make it count.

Detective Weiss walked in, hands raised, staring puzzlingly at the young bank robber who he noticed was working alone and didn't even have his gun pointed at the detective.

""H-hey dad,"" Sam said, savouring the moment.

The detective was stunned. Still, he had to keep cool. He was working with someone unstable, clearly.

""Hold on,"" Weiss said, speaking as calmly as he could. ""You gotta hold up your end of the deal. You said two hostages could go when I got here.""

Annoyed but understanding, Sam motioned for the two hostages nearest to the door.

""You two, go. No one else.""

The hostages ran outside like their life depended on it. Some officers moved up, secured the wailing people, then returned to the perimeter.

""See?"" Weiss said. ""Everything is moving smoothly and you're in control. You wanna talk, then I'm willing to talk as long as I see the hostages leaving as agreed.""

""Fine."" Sam stated flatly. He didn't want to waste any time. ""Listen. I'm your son. Maybe you don't remember me, but I remember you.""

A hostage collapsed from panic to Sam's right. He turned and leveled the gun at her.

""Get up! Nobody tries anything! This isn't Drama class. Get up!""

He was wildly waiving the gun around in her general direction. 

From behind the police barriers, it only took good timing, a window of opportunity and a clear shot.

Sam's bicep exploded by the force of the .308 caliber round that crashed through the window which was now open due to the hostage collapsing. 

The pain wasn't as intense as it should have been. Sam reeled when Weiss put the cuffs on him, but the rest was a blur, probably due to the blood loss.

He woke up in an interrogation room. The bright white light caused him to shiver. He noticed his hands were shaking while two men looked him over from the table he was cuffed to.

""I need to speak with my father, Senior Detective Carl Weiss. I won't say anything otherwise."" Sam said, quick to use the little leverage he had. 

""Oh, well..."" The man on the right said. ""We just talked to him about you. He said he couldn't remember if you were the same guy. He doesn't wanna talk to you until he can be sure, you know?""

""What the hell do you mean? He was standing right in front of me at the bank! Are you telling me he doesn't remember the literal bank robber that wanted to talk to him? Or how I wanted to send one hostage out for every minute we talked? He doesn't remember all that?""

The two men smirked. The one on the left closed a file shut and said, ""Thanks for the confession, freak.""

Sam looked up and noticed the camera in the top left corner of the room, blinking its careless red light of truth.

The one on the right leaned over to Sam. ""Oh, by the way? Any sentence is a death sentence for you. There's no access to fentanyl where you're going.""

Sam passed out again and woke up in a courtroom. There were three judges. Glaring with contempt.

""Wow! I'm important enough for three judges!"" Sam said, dreamily. A woman on his right, his attorney, leaned over to him and said, ""For the third time, this is your appeal trial. The only reason you're getting this is because cases involving  drugs have come under systematic review by the courts. Your name came up.""

Sam didn't understand any of that, really. He tried to shrug, but the immovable cast on his right arm weighed heavily, like someone caked his arm in concrete and let it dry. Sam looked at it like he had never seen a cast before.

He woke up once more in a dark room. He could hear footsteps moving outside the room. It took all of Sam's strength to stand up. He looked outside the small square window at the top of the iron door they had him locked behind. A guard was making his rounds.

""Hey, hey you!"" Sam yelled. His voice was raspy and weak.

The guard paused in place, hanging his head.

""You can't keep me in here! I'm 16! I'm not supposed to be in maximum! I need to talk to my father, Senior Detective Carl Weiss.""

The guard sauntered to the door, head still hanging low. 

""Inmate, I'm going to tell you this as many times as it takes for you to fuckin remember it, ok? You're not 16, you're 35. Detective Carl Weiss is not your father. Your father died of a fentanyl overdose when you were 16. It was your doing. You had a stash and tried to hide it in your closet. When your dad tried to do your laundry, there must have been a leak. It got through his skin. Died on the spot.

""You freaked out and tried to rob a bank to go and find your dad, thinking he left you to go and be a hot shot detective. You didn't want to see what you did. You made up a new dad that left you and your mom when you were little. Your intelligence worked against you in the court case. You had everything planned out too well. They tried you as an adult.  

""Your appeal was a complete failure. They tried to get you out of here for mental incompetence because fentanyl fried your brain and now you can't remember shit even though your clean, but again, your planning worked against you. You weren't incompetent at the time of your crimes. This is where you've been for nineteen years. You've still gotta serve the time for the dozen or so remaining counts of threatening with a deadly weapon, among others, consecutively. You'll be here another fifty years. Now, have a good day. I need to complete my rounds.""

Sam slunk back to the corner of the dark cell like he had just been scolded by a teacher at school. He used up all his energy today. He decided it was time to sleep. He needed a good rest. Tomorrow would be different.

In order to talk to him, you become a villain.",,13476,2023-11-17 15:15:28,k9pxoyd,"It all started as a game. How long would it take for him to notice me? Would he notice me at all? Or would I fail before I became important enough for him to step in? I was determined to find out. I knew he'd never even so much as glance at me if I were to approach him normally. So I opted to become someone he'd have to stop instead.

Getting a position under Loreley was the greatest starting point I could have gotten. While she wasn't his arch nemesis by far, he had his fair share of run-ins with her. She was considered a small fry in the eyes of the Council, who was tasked with eliminating world-ending threats, not your run of the mill seductress and drug boss. But every now and then he saw it as his personal duty to keep her in check.

 Working myself up the ranks there was fairly easy. Rumours had it that she once had taken quite a liking to him, turning to villainy only after he had rejected her. Seeing how transfixed she still was on him, I thought I could take advantage of that obsession. After all he and I shared a face. Mother always made sure I knew that.

I never told her that he was my father. I would have been a fool to reveal such a connection. Looking almost exactly like him was one thing, actually being related to him another. I don't know if she would have had me tortured to death or just long enough for me to be kept as a mindless pet if she ever knew the truth. I wasn't eager to find out. While she had many men before me, never had anyone seen her so infatuated with someone other then him. 

'Loreleys little mutt' soon became a target for many. Some were jealous that I was able to take the place beside the Great Seductress that they had coveted for themselves. Others thought that they could manipulate her through obaining power over me. A third group recognized my influence and wanted me out of the way. Regardless of their reason, I was always one step ahead. Even small mutts can bite, and I made them painfully aware of that.

In truth she wouldn't have cared about my death anyway. She would have been infuriated yes, but more in the way of a toddler whose favorite toy just snapped in half, not like a woman who lost her lover. The only feelings she had for me were a deep sense of longing for the only thing she could never really have, and the desire to at least approximate that experience with me. She coveted every physical part of me, so much so that I was forced to wear a mask at all times outside of her private chambers. No one should dare look at my face, for it was hers and hers alone. I didn't mind too much. This way, there was no chance he'd somehow recognize me before I was ready. I couldn't care less if she loved me or not. Having spent my entire life devoid of such an emotion, I certainly didn't need it now.

I made myself useful in more then one way. Busy as she was, she did not have a good support system of minions. She had many followers who would obey every command of her, but these suitors were unorganized, lazy and loud. It goes without mention that most of them were ordinary in every way, and even the more talented couldn't compare to a fresh recruit of the hero training program. So I took on the massive challenge of replacing every single useless parasite and replace them with someone more capable. I started saving smaller villains from her wrath, opting to make them our vassals instead. I made them forever indebted to me and my gratitude. So when I stabbed her in the back and took over her operations, the little portion who still supported only her was quickly taken care of. 

After my act of mutiny, it didn't take long until I was marked for execution. Apparently I was too much of a wild card for the Council. They confirmed not long after that their best agent would be sent to take care of me. My plan had worked. He had finally taken notice of me. 

The day of, I was making sure everything was perfect for my big reveal. I knew I'd go out one way or another, the least I could do is make it as dramatic as possible. The worst he could do was outright deny me, but I had undeniable proof of my lineage.

It was no secret that him being the strongest stemmed from the fact that he could conjure up a rare blade,touchable only by its masters. It was an ability only present in the main line branch of his family. I had inherited it, although I wasn't aware of it for a long time. No one knew I could do this, as it was the ace up my sleeve. 

And there he finally stood. He and I were alone. His companions and my henchmen were to busy fighting each other to notice whereto we both disapeared. He stared at me with eyes so familiar yet unknown before finally breaking the silence.

""You shall surrender immediately, in the name of the council!""

I chuckled.

""If you're going to kill me either way, why should I surrender first?""

It only took him a fraction of a second to plunge his blade into my chest. I knew he was terrifying, but I didn't take him for that much of a monster. Before he could twist it to end my life for good, I knocked him back and pulled it out myself. I knew that sealed my fate, but the look on his face was worth it. 

""How can you touch it? That's impossible!""

I took off my mask. Staring at me, mirroring his appearance in youth, his face became white as a sheet. That was the face I always wanted to see, ever since I discovered how to summon the sword and what that meant for my parentage.

""Are you... Could you be Lydias...?

There was something mixed into his voice that I couldn't quite recognize. It sounded sad. I always thought this would be the moment of my greatest triumph just before my inevitable end. I wanted him to recognize the trouble he'd caused in abandoning me with her. But in that moment, which should have been my most extatic, I somehow couldn't find it in me to rejoice. Something in me had always known that it wasn't his fault. He was just the proxy of my anger at everything and everyone. But here he was, shocked and sad about the revelation of him murdering the child he didn't know he had. And I realized that with this, I had achieved nothing but more heartache. Maybe that truly was all I could do in this world.

&#x200B;

When I woke up again, I couldn't make out a lot at first. For a split second I thought that this was the afterlife, but the sharp pain in my chest made me aware of the fact that I still remained among the living. The room was foreign and dark, with the only light coming from a lantern outside the otherwise night-shrouded window. I couldn't move a lot. Mostly due to the pain, but also because my hands were restrained. When I turned my head to the other side, he was there.

He was asleep, but even in slumber one could see how tired he looked. Had he been crying? The wet stains on his shirt suggested so. I wasn't sure what it was exactly that he cried about. But something within me resonated with him. I hadn't cried in ages, but maybe, just tonight, I could allow myself to cry a little.

I have one father who has no idea who I am at all besides a kid who grew to be a woman that made mistakes.  And that woman had kids unplanned which was 4 more mistakes.. No recognition of the love I came to know because of them, how beautiful and amazing they are, or the fact that they were part of me. No cards, no Christmas presents, no phone calls. Just a random email or message monthly to verify I am not dead like my mom. She died from a drug overdose. She was my best friend.. but drugs were too. 

My dad Bert raised me with my mother. He adopted me when I was 7. They divorced and things changed. He went through several marriages that often made me dissappear or become less of a priority.

Crimson Wing, international superhero extraordinaire, the man with an infinite amount of gadgets and doodads for taking on any enemy, any situation...was also my father. Just a man, just an engineer named Curtis. Before he had found himself above petty and common concerns like love, or raising a child, he was just a man. Met a nice lady, fell in love, and then accidentally reached his breakthrough at Supratech, developing a powersuit and becoming the world's premiere superhero. How convenient that was just days after mom's pregnancy was revealed.

We had so, so little, growing up. My mother, Elizabeth, was shunned for having a child out of wedlock. What little work she could get was oft not enough to support the both of us, and like the saint she was, she gave it all, she gave *her* all, to me. The son of a man who'd abandoned her for fame and power. It was only because of her that I grew to understand morality, fairness, the obligation to do that which is right that falls upon us all. I was only eighteen when those lessons were tested, because left alone and with no one else to support her, my mom worked herself to death.

I wasted no time embarking upon the path to justice. A small town boy with no parents was a hard life, but an easy sell to prestige colleges who all wanted an inspiring story of overcoming the odds. Curtis had been an expert in nanotechnology, and what research he had left behind served as the foundation for my own studies. I was hailed as a prodigy, as the next great mind of the field, and when I finished my degree early I got my own career started at Supratech. The ghost of my father's arrogance grew ever nearer to him.

Where Curtis had cut and run, leaving the labs in dark and with their key copies of the precious data gone, I swooped in to be their savior. It still took time, of course, but with the head start I had, connecting the dots was rather simple. He had spent so much time learning how to create his wondrous tools and implements, fascinated by the idea of constructing the tools to his perfect ends. But it is always easier to destroy than to create, and once I had cracked that code, I knew I could unmake not just his suit, but *him* as well.

The heads of Supratech claimed they wanted revenge as much as I did, and while I knew they could never understand my fury, their support was more than welcome. Sponsored by a megacorporation brought material wealth and stability, as well as teams of operatives willing to lend their support to my missions. With the invention of my Unravelers, I became known to the world as Doctor Dust, he who would bring ruinous oblivion to those who would harm others.

Finally, I earned my confrontation with him. Nearly a decade of living alone, studying quantum nano-fields and other technobabble, pursuing my vengeance with all that I had, and there he was. I had engineered it perfectly, an operative team getting 'caught' in the midst of a bank heist. The money was all mine, and insured at that. Not that Curtis knew- or cared. He just wanted the photo op. How devastating it must have been, then, in that glorious moment, for him to instead be brought to his knees in front of the press, taking hit after hit from the dauntless Doctor Dust.

His eponymous Crimson Wings were the first to go, since I couldn't have him running away from the destiny I had designed. Already a devastating image for his myth, but merely a start. With each punch I could feel the Unravelers working, ruthlessly shredding through any and every layer of defense he had. His nanotech gadgets were strong, but much like Curtis could not escape their calamitous end. Only when I had finally broken through to bared skin did I relent for even a moment, finally bringing light to his obscured face. Bringing light to the face of the man who had so disastrously wronged my mom.

He was grayer now, than he was in their picture. I kept it with me, to remember who I was fighting. And who I was fighting *for*. But there was no goofy smile of a lovestruck twenty something on his face- instead, a bloodied grimace, coupled with the most satisfyingly fear stricken eyes I had ever beheld. I raised him by his throat, showing off my trophy for all to see, a mere man in the derelict wreck that used to be his source of power. My nanites continued to eat away at it all, until he was truly stripped bare of all that he had made for himself, all that stopped him from facing the consequences of his past. 

""Curtis Werner,"" I had said, just as much to the gathered crowd as to him, ""You took it upon yourself to become a false idol of that which is good in this world. You lead people to believe that you were a force of justice, a hero to all! But to do that, you had cast aside those closest to you. Eliza Darrow, a wonderful woman full of life, and love, and light! A light you dimmed when you seduced her, then cast her aside for your own personal gains! A love you abandoned when you realized it would interfere in your self serving crusade! **And a life you ruined, when you chose to leave us both, damned be the consequences!** Well, I am her son, and thusly yours as well- but so too am I your consequence, Curtis, and damned be *you!*""

I cast him down, and I could see the softness of *him* bruised by the rough concrete, cuts and bruises almost immediately forming. It would have been almost pitiable if this man had not managed to wrong my mom despite his weakness. He offered meek excuses, desperate attempts to explain why he had done what he did, but it only served to enrage me more. 

Surrounded by civilians, reporters, and police officers alike, I abandoned him there. He could offer paltry words to them, but I would not have it. All I left him was the photo my mother had given me, of them together and in love, cherishing each other. I hoped it would be acid to his mind, to see what he had left behind. I hoped the media would look into that photo, and find my mother, her grave and her life story and by proxy his effects on her. I hoped they would never forgive him, just as I could not. But only time would tell.

When I got back to my...home, if it was ever such a thing, I stared into my own eyes for what felt like eternity. What I saw was only the shallow reflection of a man dedicated to destruction, at any cost. A man who's one singular purpose was suddenly nothing, leaving him aimless. For the first time in a long time, I felt an impending sense of dread. It had been so easy to hate, to let spite motivate me, but now, I had to simply live as myself. I had to create an identity outside of my parents, outside of justice or revenge or anything like that. I had to create a space for myself to be me, not simply house me and my gear. I had to create...and despite its difficulty, I knew it would be worth doing.",11,DOS_NOOB,2023-11-17 21:46:28

Little did he know, his father was a legendary crime-fighter known as ""The Guardian,"" who dedicated his life to protecting the city from evildoers.

Alex had grown up without a father, always wondering about his mysterious absence. One day, he stumbled upon an old newspaper article that revealed the truth: his father was The Guardian. Filled with a mix of excitement and longing, Alex decided to find a way to connect with his father.

But how could he reach out to a hero who had no time for anything else? Alex came up with a daring plan. He would become a villain, causing just enough trouble to grab his father's attention. With a mischievous grin, he donned a dark mask and took on the persona of ""Shadowstrike.""

As Shadowstrike, Alex began his villainous escapades, leaving behind perplexing clues for The Guardian to follow. He would steal valuable artifacts, disrupt high-profile events, and create chaos in the city. Each time, he hoped his father would notice and start piecing the puzzle together.

The Guardian, always vigilant, couldn't help but notice the rise of this new villain. He became determined to put an end to Shadowstrike's reign of mischief. The two engaged in thrilling battles across the city, each encounter bringing them closer to the truth.

As their clashes continued, Alex couldn't help but admire his father's skills and bravery. Deep down, he yearned for a connection beyond their secret identities. Finally, during their climactic showdown atop a towering skyscraper, Alex revealed his true identity to The Guardian.

Stunned and filled with a mix of emotions, The Guardian realized that the villain he had been pursuing was, in fact, his long-lost son. Tears welled up in his eyes as he embraced Alex, finally understanding the sacrifices he had unknowingly made.

From that day forward, father and son fought side by side, not as hero and villain, but as a united force for justice. The city of New Albion rejoiced as they witnessed the bond between The Guardian and Shadowstrike, a testament to the power of family and the lengths we go to find connection.

And so, their story continued, a tale of redemption, forgiveness, and the unbreakable bond between a father and his son.

Why the fuck did I take that test?
As a child, I never knew who my father was. He abandoned me when I was born, and that's a reality I've always had to live with. I've always wanted to learn what my father became after he left me and my mom, so reading the headline ""New and advanced DNA test!"" really intrigued me. Without a single thought, I went to the website posted and signed up. This was it! I was going to know who my father is!
I sent the DNA sample and waited for 2 very long and anticipating weeks. The day the test came, I was ecstatic. I would've ripped the test open if I hadn't called my friend to come over and open it with me.
""So... This is it."" I mumbled.
""Yeah! Aren't you so excited? You'll finally be able to know who your father is!"" My friend was just excited as I was, though he didn't manage to contain it as I did. We just started at that test for what felt like hours before my friend spoke up.
""So... Let's open it!""
""Fine..."" I mumbled begrudgingly.
As I cut open the letter, the tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I slowly ripped out a large piece of paper and quickly turned it around. My friend signed, sick of my procrastinating.
""Come on! Let's look at it!""
I reluctantly flipped it around, a sea of names with titles next to them. My eyes flicked across the page, looking for the anticipated ""Father"" title. My eyes finally rested on a name. Clark Kent.
2 months later
I had been trying to reach my dad for weeks, slowly discovering little clues and hints. I stare at a bulletin board, red string connecting every safety pin. They all pointed to one name, Clark Kent. Another picture of a red and blue superhero in tights with an S embroidered on his chest. Apparently, it showed a symbol of hope. Hope my ass. The only thing that man got me was years of trauma and therapy. But today was the day. I finally meet my coward of a father. I had it all planned out. It would start as a simple bank robbery, but then that asshole-man would come flying in to save the day. I was ready for this, of course, so I had rigged up 5 kryptonite traps in the cieling, which would be detected by his x-ray vision, but he had another thing coming. The day of the robbery, I would bring a red flashlight. Not enough to disable his powers, but to hinder them enough that he doesn't see the kryptonite. So with that, I set my plan into motion.
I held an entire bank at gunpoint, not that I needed them. They were just to hint that I could kill them at any time. I called out, knowing the undie-clad super-ass would hear.
""I sure hope that asshole Superman doesn't come!""
I knew he would reveal himself. He really loved big entries. How ironic.
I saw a flash of blue and red. It's time. I could barely control myself. In just a few seconds, that asshole would have to pay for the years he stole. 
His cape whooshed as he flew in, not anticipating the rocky traps falling from the ceiling. He was now in my grasp. It's time.
""You know, it's really hard to kill a super when he left you at birth.""
Confusion filled his face, quickly accompanied by shock and horror.

He didn't know how it had gotten to this point, how he had developed to this level of atrocity.  It had started small with hold ups and robberies with a fake gun, all talk and no real substance.  Of course he hadn't come, why would he?  Some meaningless petty crime in the face of the reality of the world; the death, the killing, the bloodshed.

It was part of him now, though, the last stickup devolving into some absurdist dark comedy, the cashier stumbling for his gun before dropping it on the counter, the struggle that ensued.  That man ended up dead and all the Son could do was watch as he bled out, the gun somehow in his hands rattling as loudly then as it was now.  He had laughed at the moment, taken in by the chaos and meaningless of it all.  No remorse came to him after that, only some mild disdain for fate, destiny, or luck which had led him to the moment.  He reasoned that the cashier deserved it, that he was damned by his own stupidity and bloodlust.

He didn't know how it had gotten to this point.  There was a longing in him, one born in infancy that still occupied him even in this moment as his breath shook and his limbs trembled.  Abandoned, lost, forgotten.  His mother dead, his father some hooded figure that was more imagination than reality.  Maybe not so much anymore, he had found him.  He could tell immediately, the outline of his face on the TV eerily familiar to his own, the cadence of his voice, the timbre of his laugh.  He was the Father, that much was clear.  He didn't doubt it as he stood turned away at the house and he didn't doubt it now as he held the Second Son in the chair, a revolver pointed at his head.  The hostage was sobbing, he had been since the moment he was brought to this room, his hands tied behind his back against the radiator in some old industrial warehouse.

Faint footsteps echoed the hall building themselves slowly over the gentle cries that previously filled it.  The rattling was maddening now, and he was barely able to focus on the shadow standing across from him.

'Why?' came that familiar voice.

The Son stood there unable to talk or respond.

'Whats all this death come to?'

He could barely hear the voice even now, the rattling building up into his head is some insane symphony that didn't seem to end.  He pushed it down, softening the sounds and garnering his focus.

'Do you recognize me?' he squeezed out, the sound barely audible to himself.

'What' the Father's voice fell on him?

'Do you recognize me?' the Son's voice cracked under it's pressure.

The shadow shifted it's weight, it's hands reaching into the pockets of its coat.

'How could I?' it responded.

The Son raised the revolver, pointing towards the hostage and a shot rang out.  The world went silent and cold for a moment.  There was no chaos,  no madness, no pain, only some distant coldness enveloping him.  Warmth followed, spreading itself across his chest as his legs fell from underneath him.  The Father walked across the room his hand still fixed to his gun and his eyes fixed on the Son.  He went to untie the hostage.

The Son raised the revolver as he sat against the wall and lifted it towards the Father.

'Bang' he whispered as the chamber clicked.

The world went dark around him and everything faded except for two familiar blue eyes that shined through it all, eyes that showed some vague recognition.",8,Legitimate-Design12,2023-11-17 21:31:14

God damn does it feel good. But let’s back up. 

Yesterday morning the results of my genealogy test showed that I had one, living, direct relative besides my Grandmother. She was on my mother’s side and she never knew who knocked up her daughter. Mom raised me well... well, well enough. She went to prison a few years ago for killing her coworker at the Supermarket with a pocket knife after she tried to steal from the register after hours. It was an accident. At least, I think it was. But she went away and I was on my own and going to college, now with the reputation as the son of a murderer. But that was about seven years ago so, let’s skip ahead a bit.

College went well enough. I got into a few fights, had a few drinks, got a business degree, got a girlfriend, married, had a daughter and moved into a small place in a small industrial town with a about thirty thousand people. It’s been pretty okay so far. I still talk to mom, with what little there is to say anyway. I haven’t really felt like her son in a while... when I told her that she was a grandmother, she broke down crying and said she was happy... that was a good moment. 

Either way. All that to say that my daughter recently was diagnosed with some health problems that the doctors said could be genetic. The problems themselves weren’t too bad. Some medication everyday and stop by for a checkup once a month... it was a bad situation but it was a manageable kind of bad. A small kindness I suppose. Either way, I did some research on my family to see if I had any secret relatives that could give me any insight on any genetic diseases and lo and behold. My dad is a superhero. 

Some context into the world. Heroes exist. I could tell you some long and storied history but it’s not that long and I’m not that patient. Some magical witch totem was discovered buried under a mountain about seventy years ago and gave everyone who touched it magical abilities, so long as you offered it something in return. What had to be offered was “the intangible tangible”. That was a direct translation but basically, “what you can’t touch but you can still feel.” Or in other words, emotions, memories and dreams. People offered up their happiness, their rage, their dreams and the totem gave them power. But now they had a problem. You see it took what was offered and gave power back, allowing them to move things with their mind, fly and have immense strength. But where someone who thought they were happy enough and traded what they had in abundance for power, they received it but now their happiness was gone. And now, even if they still had plenty of reasons to be happy; a family, a good job, a place to live, plenty of money, health. Suddenly, those things that would have made them happy, just didn’t. Because when they gave away their happiness, they also gave away their ability to feel it. So, where someone was happy before but relatively powerless, now they had power but they weren’t happy. And what would an unhappy person do with power? You can probably see where I’m going with this. 

So yeah, the totem was a monkeys paw. You touch it and trade something intrinsic and in return you get super powers. My father, traded memory’s. He no longer remembered his girlfriend or his son. He no longer remembered his mom or dad or his friend’s or past jobs, first loves. All he knew was what happened after. He had power and he started using it to help people. At his core, I suppose that makes him a really good guy, albeit a bit of an idiot. Either way, he helped people. Became a real “hometown hero” type.... And then my daughter died. 

It was sudden. So, impossibly sudden. Just a light complication and that’s all it was supposed to be. She had trouble breathing. We brought her in to the hospital and they took her into the ER for a minor surgery and she died three hours later.... My three year old daughter.... 

The amount of power you receive correspond to what you give. If you have little happiness, you will receive little power. Consequently, what you feel depends on who you are as a person, so a girl in her teens might feel more pain and anguish from the trauma and fear she felt as a child than an old woman who lived a relatively boring life. My father must have had quite a life up to the point that he gave his memories away because he became quite a powerful hero.... Likewise, I must have loved my daughter more than even I knew, because when I gave up my happiness, I swear that I could see the moon vibrating from my rebirth. 

I promised my wife that I’d give it up when I was done. That’s how it works. If you give up your power, you can receive what you gave, back. But it’s a final trade. You can’t go back to the totem to trade something else. Once you give it up, you’re human for good. I promised my wife I’d properly mourn our daughter with her once I found my father. Her condition was genetic so right now I blame him for not being in her life and giving her a chance to live. If we knew more about it, maybe something could have been done.... But really, that’s just an excuse. My happiness felt tainted and rage gave me comfort. I felt disgusted waking up in the morning knowing all the happiness and love I felt as a father could never be felt for my daughter again. It’s true that I could still move on with my wife. After a few years, we could try again.... But a few years isn’t now. Now, I’m hateful. Now, I’m weak. Now, I want to vent against all the unfairness in the world and burn anything in my path to my father. 

I will give up my power after I’m done. It will literally be true happiness to finally be free of it. But I don’t want to be free right now. I want rage and pain and motivation. Right now, I want to get things done. Right now.... I want to be a Villain.",6,Twijasosm,2023-11-17 19:37:40

How funny is it that your life’s going to be ruined because you didn’t know how to use protection? Worse of all, that brief night of fun resulted in another villain, one that you didn’t even know about. Hello father, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” Brett sat on his father’s couch, leaving Elemental Shift’s family tied up in the bedroom, keeping them out of this family reunion.

 

“Father? Impossible, I can’t have a son, I would have known about it. She would have said something.” Elemental pulled off his mask, the disheveled and tired man underneath, staring at Brett. He wanted only an hour of peace before he went back to the streets and couldn’t even get that in his own home. “Where’s my family?”

 

“In the bedroom.” Brett reached for a family album sat next to the tv, flicking through the photos. “We don’t need to involve them, do we? It would have left a dirty taste in my mouth to kill my half sister. I hardly care if I kill your wife, though.” Brett smirked, only to let out a laugh. “Kidding. It would be a waste of my time.”

 

Elemental went to step to the bedroom, only for Brett to bounce up from the couch, moving between them. Whenever Elemental tried to use his speed to skip past, Brett would stop him. Brett blocking the path, giving Elemental the option to either blast through his body or to stop in place.

 

“Who are you? You called yourself a villain. Which villain are you?” Elemental slowed, impatiently standing before the villain. “It’s ok, honey. You’re safe. I have this handled.” He called out.

 

“I forgot. I’m not exactly dressed in my suit. Poison Dart’s the name I go by. I know, not the best name, but how good of a name do you need when you don’t have powers?” He slid a finger into his hoodie sleeve, pulling out a small sharp sewing needle. “A jab with this and a person dies in five minutes. Not a bad invention, right? That’s only breaking the surface of my creations, too.”

 

“Poison Dart. I’ve heard about you. You really think you’re my son. Who's your mother then?” Elemental could see the resemblance. Same brown hair, same blue eyes. The only feature that wasn’t his was that button nose. That same button nose that she had.

 

“I was hoping you would tell me. Seems she wasn’t much of a mother, abandoned me. Real shame, too. I would have loved to work with her. Is she still active?” Brett returned to the couch, motioning Elemental to sit across from him. 
“Your mother’s dead. If you are who you say you are, then she’s dead.” He stared at his lap, contemplating whether he should have mentioned that to the villain sitting across from him. Even if he wouldn’t like the news, he felt he owed him the truth. Elemental reluctantly taking a seat across from him.

 

“What a relief. I thought she abandoned me. That’s easier to swallow.” Brett kept up the joyful act, even if his eyes remained ever cold. After a second of reeling back against the couch in fake joyful cheer, he leaned forward. “Who killed her?”

 

“Why?”

 

“Because I’m going to kill them. An eye for an eye and all that. Yes, I know that saying is anti revenge, but I’m already blinded by my rage, so I haven’t got an eye to lose at this point. If that makes sense.”

 

Elemental saw it, that anxious unrest that villains got before they were about to do something unredeemable. His foot tapping against the floor, focus squarely on Elementals face, not even blinking. He was focused only on this idea of revenge, unable to see anything else.

 

“I killed your mother. Her name was Phantom Mist” Elemental sighed, watching Poison Dart’s face contort into a mix of anger, pain, and hurt. He knew about Phantom Mist, he had based his darts on the poison she had perfected. To think his own mother had inspired him, he would have found it funny in different circumstances.

 

“YOU KILLED HER? Why would you kill her? What to cover up for yourself? You bastard, I’m going to kill you. I’ll kill your whole family. I’ll kill everyone, you know.” He snapped, pointing the dart at Elemental, his body shaking as he threatened to put his father down.

 

“I didn’t mean to. I didn’t even know she had a kid, or that the kid was mine. She never mentioned you existed.” Elemental hated thinking about that day. No hero enjoyed having to kill a villain. Any hero that did couldn’t consider themselves a real hero. Sure, sometimes it was needed, but it never felt good. “We were fighting, and I hit her mask. She got poisoned by her own gas. By the time I realized it, I couldn’t save her.”

 

“Like I believe that. You wanted her dead. You probably wished I was still inside her, didn’t you? You would have loved to rid the world of us, get rid of your mistakes.”

“It wasn’t like that. I cared for her. I thought she could be redeemed. She was making good progress too and then one day, she snapped and went back to her old ways. It was strange. It was like her heart wasn’t even in it, like she was just doing it because she felt she needed to. I wonder what happened.”

 

That day had never sat right with him. Phantom Mist wasn’t a crazed killer, nor was she the type to choose a target without months of careful planning. Everything about that day was unlike her. He had never worked out why she attacked on that day, only assuming it may have had something to do with Poison Dart. Even if he couldn’t figure out the connection.

 

“You happened.” Dart lunged forward, swiping the needle at his father. On instinct, Elemental raised a hand, sending a blast of air into his chest. The blast was weak, something he only ever did to blow back a weaker villain, but Poison Dart was barely a weak villain. Without powers, his body was entirely mortal. That strike of air pushing Dart’s ribcage towards his heart, causing a heart attack.

 

Poison Dart froze. He didn’t have any intention of hitting his father, stopping himself before he even got close. The look of betrayal evident as he dropped the needle, clutching his chest. Elemental watched, unable to move as his son fell to the floor, weakened and struggling to stay conscious.

 

Elemental saw his son’s state and rushed to the bedroom, leaving his son alone on the floor as he freed his family, who were unharmed, as Poison Dart promised. He hugged them, assuring them that everything was alright, before finally calling an ambulance, telling his family to stay in the bedroom. The ambulance soon arrived, and Elemental was left to explain the situation.

 

“What happened?” The paramedic asked, the two watching as they pulled a blanked over Poison Dart. Covering him from anyone neighbors that peered through their windows.

 

“The villain took a blast of focused air to the chest. I think it may have caused some internal damage. I called you as soon as I could, but I think I was too late.”

 

“I see. Pity if we got here sooner, we might have been able to do something for him. Poison Dart, right? Lower end criminal. Don’t worry, you had no choice. He was in your home. What were you going to do? I would have done the same thing to protect my kids.” The paramedic gave him a pat on the back, confident that no one would blame Elemental for defending his home. Every villain knew that a home visit was against the code of honor, so dying because of it was something that should have been expected. 
“Yeah, pity.” Elemental watched his son get driven away, only able to think about the news reports that would come out if they ever did the autopsy. He assumed Phantom Mist’s blood was on the record, as was his. If they ever tested Poison Dart, they would find the origin of the bastard child and he would be ruined.

 

He hated that he was even thinking about that at a time like this. Maybe he needed to distance himself from his son to keep himself from feeling sick. Viewing him as a villain didn’t make him feel any less guilty, only making it feel less severe and disgusting. At least he would be with his mother, was all Elemental could think as he returned to his family, embracing them.

Upon your investigation you've learned more and more how he and the mayor and the police chief are all working together screwing over the public funding and taking cuts and skimming off the top of public funds to fund their own agendas. You find out he is basically an agent for the chief and the mayor is also in on it, as a mercenary of sorts that holds up all the leaders of vice in the city. He would stick up the underground casinos and drug dealers and come across as a robin hood type but at the end of the day he plants evidence for arrests or to get his targets off the street long enough to have himself or squadrons of crooked underling cops and small time gangsters to swoop into the properties of these criminals while they're tied up being held at the station or jail- whatever it is. Then the riches get held at the station or brought directly to the mayor's office or house. The closer you get to figuring out this cycle of unethical crime you realize that you are now the one being targeted.

One night you confront him and rip your mask off as he goes to give you a fatal blow after a long fighting sequence. He sees it's really you, his son, he's about to hit and flings himself off of you and over a ledge on the roof of a high-rise apartment building. When you look over to see where he lands he's gone. He must have pulled some batman type move and fled somewhere so fast.

The next day in the paper you see he held a press conference, essentially ratting himself out and causing a huge distrust of the police and local government. This causes riots and now your the one crime fighter and must continue to dawn your costume and fight crime through these troubling times. Your father only correspondence with you now is random mailings from all across central and south America. The mayor was arrested and the chief was fired. 

You eventually travel down to south America for one last attempt to find your father. He has become a sicarios for an extremely deadly organization that is employed by cartels. When you go to confront him you have to face down a whole band of sicarios and security at the place of his employment at a 500 acre farm of poppy plants and marijuana and different labs for different designer drugs as well. The town had a randomly 1,000 new citizens of Russian origin in the area/ city proper of 8,000 people in all. You have to find him. He isn't some hot shot, just a ruthless mercenary hitman at that point. Addicted to cocaine and gambling, he was fucked up most of the time, a shell of himself and relying on his marksmanship over physicality at this point in his life. He was getting older and older doesn't equate to living a longer life in his new world/career choice, he looked like he had just a few years left anyway. 

Unaware it's you, your father only hears of a single man, El Solhe was known as he was everywhere, seemingly, taking out a bunch of people however, it was never known that it was very selective hits in search of your father.  You one day confront him. He really fucks you up and disappears once again but for good. As other Sicarios encircle the area you slip into some hole in the wall in a motel and there you try not to bleed out.

Their eyes baring down on you like spotlights, the fog of the sea replaced with whisping smoke of differing odors. At the time, they where like a circling of reapers. Some laughing, some watching with lethal intent. Some voicing their doubt that you have the commitment, surely making you as a ""narc"". All of them united in deciding your fate as a cartel dealer.

But this was different. It didn't quickly pass, leaving behind not only the euphoria of intoxication, but the approval of those daunting figures. This was deeper. Deeper...and wet. 

You look up from your torso, your mind shaking off enough of the shock to return the the present. A grizzled man. Haggard, with dark swollen eyes. He's seems to be yelling at you. Spit flying from his mouth. You focus on the movements of his mouth, grinning besides yourself. Your mother always told you that you have your father's cheek bones. You can see it now.

""...said put you hands above your head! This is the last I'll say it before I waste another into your skull and piss on you for the trouble!"" 

The pains gone. But so is the feeling in your legs. They finally buckle after the shakes become too inconsistent to keep balance anymore.

Internally, I'm panicking and trying to decide if I should tell him or if I should just play my part. I absent-mindedly play with remote in my hand as I wait. Suddenly, there is a muffled thud from the next room. ""It's showtime,"" I think to myself as I slip back into character. 

The door to the room is kicked in with a loud bang. Here comes the hero.... my father. He immediately goes to neutralize my armed associates, and after taking out the last one, he runs over to me and my hostage.

""Everything is okay now. You're safe."" He tells us both. The girl and I struggle against the ropes binding us as a man walks in, holding a gun and a detonator. The girl screams against the gag in her mouth as I shake my head to warn the hero and to tell the intruder to back down.

The gun goes off, and a bullet tears through to the hero's shoulder as he cries out in pain. The stupid mechatronic didn't listen to my command. He wasn't supposed to shoot him. I glare the machine as it stands in front of the injured hero, its face hidden behind a mask. The hero waits until the robot is closer and springs up to disarm the machine of the gun. With his injured shoulder, there is a struggle to control the detonator. The robot finally regains control and begins his pre-programmed generic spiel about ""his"" plan to capture the governor's daughter to force him to pay a ransom and provide transportation to a safe haven. 

As the robot drones on, I watch the hero.  ""So this is the hero's final rally,"" I think to myself as I examine how he reacts to the plan and watches as he gathers his strength once more. He checks on me and the girl as the speech continues. Finally, the robot begins to wrap up his speech. ""It's was foolish of you to come here, Blue Light.... or should I call you Sgt. Oscar Sierra?"" The hero freezes mid-rally and asks in a cold voice, ""How do you know that name?""

""That's for me to know and you to die for,"" the robot says as he picks up the gun again to aim at Oscar. Oscar is still bent down, with one hand holding his injured shoulder. In a single breath, three things happen. First, Oscar grabs a hidden knife from his boot and launches it at the robot. Upon impact, the robot squeezes the trigger on the gun and on the detonator. The last thing was completely unplanned, and I was surprised to find my body attempting to knock Oscar out the way. 

Considering my bound state, it worked better than I would've expected. Oscar, having lost his balance, is partially on his side on the floor with a confused look on his face. The girl is screaming against her gag, which causes Oscar to look back at us. The robot was on the floor unresponsive after hitting the button on his detonator. Unbeknownst to him, both detonators were to control him, and if need be, turn him off. 

""Is getting hard to breathe,"" I think to myself as I try to roll over. The pain in my chest is growing more persistent. Suddenly, Oscar is over me and tearing off the ropes. He has a panicked look in his eye, and he keeps repeating something, ""... it's.... gonna...... hospital!"" As I close my eyes, I think,  ""So this is my dad. The hero, Blue Light. He's not as cool a the media makes him look. I'll make a better plan next time so we can spend more time together.""",4,Ancient-Web5515,2023-11-17 20:54:52

He seemed a bit perplexed at how it looked exactly like the inside of his home. I could hear him as he yelled at me. Daring me to come fight him. I just stare, watching him. After all these years I have him in my grasp. We could be a family, if he didn't want to utterly obliterate me.

Eventually I press a button and the TV turns on. I can see him as he stops and glares at the screen. He looks just like he did in the pictures mom had of him. He hadn't aged a bit. I found out at the age of 25, I too shared whatever it was that made him age slowly. I was 75 now and looked the same as I did on my 25th birthday. My mom noticed I hadn't aged. I assumed it was from the experiments, but she told me the truth. Thus my obsession began.

I had hoped to capture him while mom was alive. She still loved the idiot.  I frowned as I watched him. I wished she had been the one that didn't age. The one standing before me. Eventually the super hero began to rant and I held up a finger to silence him. “Save it. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to talk.” I grabbed mom's picture from my desk, holding it up and tapping a gloved finger on it. “She loved you. You left her because you didn't have the time. Saving the city was more important than her broken heart.”

I put the picture down, facing towards me so I could see them both. “Diane understood it was just a fling when we met. She knew I couldn't lo..”

I cut him off, slamming both of my hands on the desk as I stood up. Rage pulsed through me. I had wanted to be a family. To talk. Now I wanted to make him pay for the hurt he caused my mother. “You didn't deserve her love. Thankfully, you did give her something. Someone to love her. Me.” I grinned now, moving my finger to a button. “See you in hell, you heartless piece of shit.” I pressed the button and a single blade moved to remove his head.

A worn-out envelope, unearthed from the darkest corner of my late mother's belongings, revealed a truth I never fathomed. The man I'd never known, my father, wasn't just absent; he was a revered crime-fighter, a paragon of justice consumed by his endless crusade against wrongdoing.

The revelation struck a chord within me, a resonance that propelled me into a vortex of conflicting emotions. Eager to bridge the chasm between us, yet bereft of a conceivable means to connect, I concocted a reckless scheme: to enter his world through the veil of darkness, the only sphere where he remained an active participant.

I delved into the depths of the city's underbelly, masking my identity behind a moniker whispered in hushed tones—The Shadowed Specter. It was a persona crafted from desperation, a guise adopted to catch his attention amidst the chaotic battleground of good and evil.

As The Shadowed Specter, I embarked on a spree of calculated chaos, threading a web of crimes designed not for personal gain but to provoke the hero whose blood coursed through my veins. My actions weren't fueled by malice, but rather by the unyielding desire to unravel the enigma that was my father.

Each heist, every skirmish with the law, brought me closer to the inevitable clash with the emblem of righteousness, the figure whose existence had been my elusive beacon. Yet, with every shadow I slipped into, every alleyway I traversed under the shroud of darkness, the weight of my dual identity intensified. I was torn between my genuine yearning to connect and the persona I'd fabricated to make it possible.

My encounters with him were fraught with tension, a delicate balance between yearning for acknowledgment and evading the grim reality of facing justice. I could sense his unwavering commitment, the noble fervor in his pursuit of a safer city, a commitment that mirrored my own but from the opposite end of the moral spectrum.

The inevitable confrontation loomed on the horizon, a cataclysmic collision between the forces of good and the facade of my malevolent alter ego. But as fate would have it, in the throes of our climactic showdown, a twist of fate unraveled the intricate tapestry of secrets.

The mask slipped away, not just the physical guise but the veiled truth of my identity. His gaze bore into mine, a revelation cascading in his eyes as recognition dawned. A symphony of emotions played across his weathered face—shock, disbelief, and, hidden beneath the layers, a glimmer of paternal recognition.

In that fleeting moment, amid the chaos and the clashing ideologies, a bridge transcending hero and villain materialized—a bridge of bloodlines, of shared purpose, and an unspoken acknowledgment that even the greatest battles can be fought within one's own heart.",4,worldwarzack,2023-11-17 21:19:42

He threw the molten ball of energy at me, which was easily stopped in midair by the forcefield. I picked up the pulsing orb, protected by specially made gloves.

I couldn't hold back the emotion bubbling up in me; a laugh abruptly left my lips. ""I've always wanted to do this since I was a kid!"" I giggled.

""What, fighting a superhero?"" His eyes narrowed in confusion. ""Boy, I don't know what you've seen on TV, but...""

Away from the screams and the crying, the sounds of buildings tumbling to the ground, the sirens blaring as they pitifully try to save the poor little people. Poor little people in their poor little lives. Maybe I did them a favor.

An enticing thought. 

I look down and can’t help feel a rush of pride at the scene...of the sheer power I wrought. A baptism by fire and destruction all across the cityscape, the flames and rubble creating a patchwork mixed with an abundance of crimson; I probably don’t need to explain to you what from. You know, my mother always did call me overdramatic. She may have had a point, but you know what? I needed to make an even bigger one. 

It all started the moment my mother died, and finally revealed my birth father was none other than our own illustrious protector The Guardian. (I still shudder at just how cliche that name is.) I didn’t believe her at first mind you, but it became clear when my latent powers activated in the grief following her passing, considering The Guardian was the only super-powered person on Earth. Hard to ignore really. 

Despite what you may think of me, I’m not heartless. Ruthlessness is born of passion, and passion is born of heart, as they say. I loved my mother, she was the hardest fighter I’ve ever known. She wouldn’t have had to fight though, had it not been for him. Saving everyone else before saving his own flesh and blood. Rescuing the helpless and pummeling the scum of the Earth, but those who abandon their own family are worse than scum, and it’s finally time he knows it. 

“What have you done?!?”

The voice is booming, cutting through the silence like a scythe. I’m not phased, nor am I impressed. I am eager though, to finally start what I’ve longed to for quite some time. He appears in front of me, the sonic boom of his super sonic flight making the air itself tremble. Above all else, he looks tired. Good.

“It’s about time Guardian. Off your game?”

I smirk. I’m enjoying this. 

I’ve earned this.

“Wipe that smile off your face you monster or I’ll knock it off myself!”

I give credit where it’s due, he does pull off intimidating rather well. Maybe I take after him in that regard. I frown as the venom starts penetrating my words. 

“I’m dying for you to try it old man.”

His rage is palpable as he scans the scene of devastation still unfolding below us. Angry tears appear on his cheeks as he looks back at me; I can almost taste them.

“Who are you? Why have you done this?”

I roll my eyes; cliche name and cliche questions.

“Why? Let’s just put it this way. No good deed goes unpunished.”

I can see it in his eyes, a spark of confusion.

“Take a good, long look at me Guardian. Think long and hard about it. Someone else comes along with powers...”

His eyes widen, still filled with tears,

“No...you can’t possibly mean...”

I smile crookedly and chuckle as the realization hits him harder than I plan to down the line. 

“But...I’m a hero. How can you-“

“Because the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and now my sole purpose in life is making sure that you spend each and every day there...Dad.”

It’s here that I reveal my arms from behind my back and toss to him what I’d been holding onto; the head of one Olivia Yates. Physical therapist, Pisces, wants...or wanted I guess, to take photography classes and go sailing in the Galapagos. The same Olivia Yates who 29 years ago found herself a hostage on a hijacked flight, who then found herself rescued by the ever so gallant Guardian. 

The same Olivia Yates who The Guardian flew off with, leaving my mother high and dry, 3 weeks along. 

Like I said. Lower than scum.

He stares at her head as the blood still trickles out from her neck, the frozen look of pained and frightened agony on her face etching itself into his mind; this will be his last memory of his little whore. I’ve never been happier in my life.

“Can’t save ‘em all pops. Don’t worry, there’s plenty more coming your way.”

He takes one final, defeated look at me. I relish in it for a split second before blasting away, laughing as I zoom into the distance.

I really did earn this.",3,TongueTyedTurtle,2023-11-17 21:35:28

Tim's life was as normal as a three-legged dog in a hopping contest until he uncovered a truth so bizarre, it made quantum physics look like child's play: his absent father was none other than The Splendiferous Man, Earth's most apathetic superhero.

The Splendiferous Man, known for his ability to fly (albeit with a fear of heights) and super strength (which he mostly used to open tight jars), was less a superhero and more a super-maybe. Tim, on discovering this paternal bombshell, felt a mixture of awe and a strong urge to lie down in a dark room for a bit.

But lying down wasn’t Tim’s style (mostly because his sofa had been repossessed). He decided to confront his father. How? By becoming a supervillain, naturally. Thus was born Dr. Diabolical, master of mild inconvenience.

Dr. Diabolical's first dastardly deed was to replace The Splendiferous Man's almond milk with regular milk. The horror echoed through the city as The Splendiferous Man faced his greatest challenge yet: mild lactose intolerance.

Their first meeting was an anti-climax. The Splendiferous Man arrived, floating awkwardly, like a balloon caught in a gentle breeze.

“Stop right there,” he said with the enthusiasm of someone reading a microwave manual.

Tim, wearing a costume that was 50% bedsheet and 50% poor life choices, retorted, “Ah, we meet at last!”

“Do we?” The Splendiferous Man squinted. “Sorry, I forgot my glasses.”

This set the tone for their future encounters. Dr. Diabolical’s master plan involved creating a device that turned all the city's traffic lights permanently yellow. The resulting hesitation caused hours of moderate confusion.

The Splendiferous Man responded by writing a strongly worded letter to the local council, which was promptly ignored.

One fateful day, as Dr. Diabolical was executing his most ambitious plan yet – broadcasting reruns of soap operas on every channel – The Splendiferous Man floated down, carrying a white flag and a sandwich (it was lunchtime, after all).

“Look,” he sighed, “I get it. You want attention. But could you maybe, I don’t know, start a blog or something?”

Tim paused. The absurdity of the situation was suddenly as clear as the extra-terrestrial origins of Earth's dolphins.

“Are you my dad?” Tim finally blurted out, foregoing the villainous rhetoric.

The Splendiferous Man choked on his sandwich. “Well, that was unexpected,” he sputtered.

What followed was a conversation so profoundly awkward, it could only happen in a universe where people thought naming a planet “Earth” was a good idea. They talked about Tim's childhood, The Splendiferous Man's chronic superhero fatigue, and their mutual dislike of family reunions.

In the end, Dr. Diabolical hung up his villainous cape (it needed washing anyway), and The Splendiferous Man took up a new hobby – fatherhood. It was unconventional, mildly dysfunctional, but in a universe where people believed wearing capes was a fashion statement, it was just about right.

And so, Tim and The Splendiferous Man formed an odd, yet endearing bond, proving that even in a universe filled with inexplicable oddities, the strangest thing of all can sometimes be family.",4,Darth_Tiresias,2023-11-17 22:17:17

 “Dont laugh!” my father said pointing at me with his laser gun. 

“I’m not!” I said pointing at him with my death ray. 

“You’re so dramatic by the way. I figured it out less then an hour ago, and didn't scream at the sky. Way to make a kid feel wanted.” 

“Why!?” he asked. I glared at him, feeling my face tighten and my black tattered cap whip around like mad in the wind. 

“...Why what?” I asked. 

“Why did you make a giant death Ray to threaten planet earth?!” My father shouted. I snorted again. It sounded funny when he put it like that. 

“Stop laughing!” 

“I’m not!... you could be impressed that I made a giant death ray in less then an hour...Dad”

“I-I am impressed!” 

He shot his laser gun. A brilliant blue beam of light darted at me. I don't know why I didn't expect it, maybe because I was trying to be serious.

A woman cowers against the far wall. “You don’t have to do this!” 
I look at her and she quiets, but I know her trembling lips are not sealed. “We won’t tell anyone what we’ve seen. What you look like.”
The brave ones murmur their agreement. Most remain still. 
“Didn’t I tell you to be quiet?” I snap. Silence falls. 
I return my attention to the city, pulsing with life through the night. Police cars begin to swarm on the street. A helicopter orbits us at the 54th floor. 
Where are you?
“P-please!” She sputters. “We have families! Children! Husbands and wives!” 
I glance around at the two dozen people I’ve taken hostage in this penthouse, all of them averting my gaze. I roll my eyes and stand, hefting my sword off of the desk.
I approach the woman, who weeps at the sight of my sword. She backs against the wall as I draw close, those sat near her scooting away. 
I kneel in front of her, resting my sword against my shoulder. 
She’s older than most everyone else, her hair greying and skin beginning to sag. Her body spasms with sobs. 
The room gasps as I reach out and press a finger against her lips. “Shhhhhh.” 
Petrified at my touch, the woman trembles. I lift my finger, but don’t withdraw it. “If I have to tell you one more time, I’m going to slit your throat, okay? Nod if you understand.”
Harrowed, the woman nods three times. 
“Good.” I stand, turning to address the room. “Just, please shut the fuck up, and you’ll be fine, yeah. That’s all you have to do.”",3,itselijah16,2023-11-17 22:45:58

The sun was shining over my face as I squinted my eyes and the air was fresh but my breath was slow yet unsteady. Firearms were flying beside me and the helicopter's sound was starting to hurt my ears. 

This is it. This is where I fell to my death and finally able to meet him and talk to him. 

My father. 

A familiar shadow appeared before me in the smoke and debris that were scattered all around me and I smiled, laughed even. After all this time, all this year of being evil and a villain in someone's else life, I finally able to face him. I grabbed the glowing blue sword from behind my back and before I could unsheathe my weapon, a flash of light and flashed before my eyes and my vision started to get blurry. 

And there he was. And there I was. A villain that's been hunted and wanted for a long time, defeated by his own father under the falling rain and dark sky. He unveiled his mask and my eyes widened. He looked just like me. He turned off his energy blast from the hole inside my body and took off my mask. 

With every ounce of the strength I had left, I said, in a quivering voice, ""So long, Father.""

He narrowed his eyebrows and then saw it. The birth sign. A diamond symbol on his chest. He realized. But the silence was the only companion he had and he was no longer there. The thunder roared and the rain buried the father's tears as only God knows how long he grief inside the darkness.",3,Zestyclose_Half_3354,2023-11-17 23:11:52

I ask, the wind whipping by me at untold speeds as I whipped past buildings, stacks of smoke and sirens occupying the air from my morning exploits

a gloved fist flies past my head as my colorfully dressed pursuer closes the distance ""How the hell would I recognize you in a mask?"" the man asked, throwing another punch at where my head used to be. I dropped suddenly, twisting under him and flying up on the other side. A yellow blur rising to meet me. I flicked my hand out, producing a photo in my fingers. ""Maybe she looks more familiar,"" I say, tossing the photo to the cities great 'Enforcer'. Surprisingly, he actually looked at it ""Yeah, I dated her... what like..."" his brow furrowed ""how do you know who she is?""

""You dated her 23 years ago, her name is Madelyn Lynch""

'I... 23 years"" his brow furrows as he looks at me ""how do you know that?""

""I'm 23""

""and?""

""I guess the cities best defender wasn't the cities best scholar"" I removed my mask, my face bearing a striking resemblance to the woman in the picture

""...oh""

""It's good that you fly faster than you think""

""Does this have anything to do with this morning?""

""You didn't answer my emails'

""so you set a bank on fire?!""

""you didn't answer my letters either""

""I never got any letters""

""...fucking mail system"" I muttered

""You blew up a bank to talk to me?""

""least I didn't show up looking like a bumble bee""

""Kids like it""

""Not yours, evidently""

there was a long silence, just long enough to be uncomfortable

""So you're my..."" he furrowed his brow again ""um, my... daughter?"" he ventured, guessing at my androgynous appearance

""Sometimes,... but child is preferrable, I guess""

""meaning?""

""oh fuck if I know, look, the back of the photo has an address, somewhere we can talk more privately. There's too many eyes here""

""Fine, when?""

""Well, there's a... something I need to stop first, maybe like, an hour?""

""Did you do something else?!""

""I needed a contingency, in case I lost my nerve"" I admitted, unsure of how embarrassed to be about it ""anyway, see you pops""

I flew away, quickly dipping behind the buildings and finding an alleyway. I loved the feeling of the eyes drifting away, and once they were all gone, I slipped into the void. The space opened to my touch, slipping around me like water, it felt cold and thick like glass. I moved through the void with ease, faster than I could in the main world. I finally reached my destination, an abandoned building on the far side of the city, a small explosive on the top, nothing spectacular, just an attention getter. After quickly disabling it I slipped away once again. This time to a train station, old, abandoned, and connected to a similarly abandoned subway system. Fix some water damage and a few structural issues and voila, perfect villain lair. I took off my mask and jacket, replacing them with jeans and crop top, untied my hair, made two braids and tied them back, the rest hanging free. I summoned a small piece of the void in my hand, a small chunk of black glass and checked my look in the reflective surface, then let it dissipate. 

One more trip into the void, this time to a small cafe, chipped yellow paint on the outside walls, no more than three people at peak hours, a red neon sign with enough letters burned out to turn ""Phyllis' finer diner"" into the ""piss in diner"", and only a front for the mob on Thursdays. Perfect for a family reunion, or just union I guess?

I walked around the front, once again feeling observed. I pushed the door open and took a seat, now all that was left to do was wait.",3,Stormwrath52,2023-11-17 23:36:24

He’ll probably not know who I am, but after I reveal our connection, I’m sure we will be best of buds. To be honest this was a poorly thought out “plan”, if you can call it that, since I spent half of last week getting wasted and it’s mostly a blur, meanwhile tonight was kind of a spur of the moment thing, I just had enough of his arrogance, grabbed the nearest object with sufficient weight so I could start bashing things in hopes he’d show up. I went on my rampage in an alley because doing that in a major street would bring too much attention and I don’t want to get blasted by some random guy, my business is with only one man!

I think that's nonsense—we string together a series of decisions, and everyone else gets to sort it out for you. Let them. It's not my place to care what people say about me. It is my place to do what needs doing, and I don't outsource my joy. I enjoy watching a good baseball game. Let everyone figure out how much a piece of shit I am in the returns. It'll come out in the wash. I'm doing just fine munching my stale chips, keeping score of the plays on my scorecard. Nick Berger just turned a 6-4-3 double-play.

I'm at John Muir's Hollis Field. The Muir Mustangs are up a run, it's 2 - 1, and it's a tight game against the defending CIF champs, Wilks Creek Billies. They're all teenagers, but they've been training for this, the hard work has matured them and it's all coming together.

My father never watched me play baseball, although I never could play ball in the first place, we had no money my mom and I. He wasn't there. I always said I'd be the kind of father he couldn't be; it would be an easy thing to do. I remember the day I asked my mother what happened to him, my father. "" He flew away, son; he just flew away, "" she said, talking about him like he was a bird. Why would he flap his wings and fly away, I wondered. 

My mom and I didn't have the big three (phone, electricity, gas) all at one time. We had one or maybe two of them, but never all three. I did the homework by candlelight many times. When I struggled with math once, my mom said, "" You know, your father is really good at math. She didn't mean it to be cruel. Still, this amorphous concept of a father seemed as real as Daffy Duck or having heat and electricity during the winter months. He wasn't there, and he didn't help when every penny would have made a difference.

I'm not even mad about it—I'm not angry that my father wasn't around. I rarely thought about him at all. Maybe that's the tradgedy in all of it. It was just me and my mom. My mom liked to say baby doll, it's you and me versus the world here. And she was right; we scraped by, we made ends meet. 

I was sitting in the principal's office, bleeding from my face. Randy Carmichael sucker punched me while I got a drink from the water fountain in Earth Science class. I don't know why he took his eyes off of me but I hit him with a beaker, smashed it on his smug shit-eating-grin face, and then I kicked him in the balls as hard as I could. I lost a tooth and got my cheek cut up. I looked up at the TV in the office to see a familiar man—my father. It was my first time seeing him outside of a faded photograph. It was him. I could see myself in him. He was holding court over a group of reporters talking about cleaning up the streets and giving Portland back to the people. He was some kind of super cop or some bullshit. It could never be me, I said.

Randy and I had been suspended for three days for the fight. He approached me, wanting to apologize the day we returned to school. He reached out to shake my hand and say he was sorry. I grabbed his hand in a firm shake and gave him a hug. As he pulled away, I held onto his hand and kicked him in the balls again as hard as I could. That's when my Villain Era began. I eventually got kicked out of that school. And I'd get expelled from two other schools before barely graduating.

When I realized dishwashing wasn't the lucrative business opportunity I was sold on by the mustachioed shithead who hired me I looked elsewhere, got real creative. I stole money from an elderly woman when the wind blew her cash out of the ATM. I grabbed a few one-hundred dollar bills as I flipped her off—we're gonna have electricity, I thought to myself. I sold pot to kids, and the money was good. I dropped out of high school—I had to learn how to impersonate a woman's voice to call the school as my mom to get myself reinstated. I never had the heart to tell her, you're my sunshine boy, she'd say to me. I couldn't let her down. Not me, I'm not my father, I'd say to myself... 

When I graduated high school, I joined a group of activists who were pro-labor, anti-cop and anti-whatever the government was doing, and it was a good time. We bombed a couple of police cars and tagged countless law enforcement offices and police cars, saying fuck the police wherever we went. I never got caught. Every tag, every act of defiance and disrespect against the police state was me spitting in the face of my father. 

I grew older, fatter, and increasingly gray and began watching baseball games. And now Nick Berger is up to bat. He's got a runner in scoring position—he's got ice running through his veins, and his focus is intense. He waits on the first pitch. It's a ball. He settles back into his stance, waiting for the pitcher's next delivery, and here it comes. 

A loud clank flies off the bat as the ball goes into deep right, bouncing off the wall. Nick legs out a triple and scores an insurance run for the 'Stangs. I throw my chips in the air, not caring who gets rained on. They mostly fall on the man in front of me. He snarls at me Hey watch out with that shit. What's wrong with you? I'm trying to watch my kid's game here.

I narrow my eyes as I stare through the man and want to tell him something. I've been waiting my whole life to say Hey fuck you! I didn't need you, you're a shitty father, and your kid deserves better. But I don't... My eyes soften and I shift my focus to Nick, who just slid into home base. He's getting mobbed by his team. I can feel Nick's excitement. He's on top of the world, not caring about anything but the game in front of him. 

He's loved. You can tell when someone is loved when someone has what they need. They're content, safe, and just don't know it. Nick is the kid I mourn every day of my miserable existence. Nick is the kid my father denied me to be through his absence. I watched Nick, my son, celebrating with his team. He doesn't know who I am, and as much as I want to rush down and tell him how proud I am of him, I know that I can't. My heart melts just the same; he's happy. He probably doesn't know that I exist, and I hope that's the case, that he never has to toil with the concept of an absent father missing his victories and failures and just being a kid. I was afraid to fuck my kid up the same way I had been, that's the story I tell myself, the one I tell when I go on first dates. But I know better. I was scared and it makes me wonder: What my father scared, too? 

I never wanted to become my father, but here I am, here we all are.",2,entreethagiant,2023-11-17 22:37:11

*“Burn complete. Trajectory nominal. A further velocity reduction burn will commence in T minus 17 minutes. Orbital insertion burn expected at T minus 2 hours and 13 minutes. You may de-harness until T minus 15 minutes .”*


“Thanks,” I muttered, wondering aloud why I was thanking some non-sentient AI pilot software for doing it’s job.


“A bit ironic, isn’t it?” George was now floating above the jump seat that he’d been strapped into during the burn. He certainly took safety seriously for an imaginary person.


“What is?”


“Judging yourself for talking to an AI when you’ve been having long, philosophical discussions with me for months now. Didn’t you say you thought me up?”


“Exactly. I did. You're in my head, and I’m sentient. That makes you far more sentient than some generic pilot software.”


George thought for a moment. “Are you sure I’m imaginary? Do you actually remember thinking me up?”


“George you’re literally wearing what I imagined you wearing. You look like what I imagined you to look like. I named you. I remember thinking you up. I remember
*when* I thought you up. You’re entirely a figment of my imagination.”


“You definitely *think* that’s true, I’ll grant you that, but you’re doubting yourself, aren’t you? You can’t be sure any more. When was it again, exactly, that you thought me up?”


“It was as we approached the Alpha Centauri system, I wished I had someone to share the moment with and...”


The radio crackled to life. *""Mission control to Sirius 47. Ship control systems are reporting multiple lifeforms aboard. Please advise.""*


It took me almost a minute to process what I’d just heard.


“What the hell are they on about? That’s not even possible.”


“COMPUTER!” George shouted, his voice sounding different. “Cancel all further manoeuvres.”


*”Orbital manoeuvres cancelled. Manual mode enabled.”*


“What the hell are you doing? If we don’t perform the burns we'll go flying straight past!


Computer, show trajectory path if orbital insertion burn is missed.”


I already knew the answer. 


The holographic display flashed into life, cancelling the ship’s dim circadian lights that had been in evening mode. I winced at the brightness of the holographic sun as a white line traced an almost dead straight line passing thousands of miles ahead of Earth’s path and inside the orbits of Venus and Mercury. The good news was, I wouldn’t hit the sun. The bad news was that I would fly past it at such a velocity that I would spend thousands of years in an elliptical heliocentric orbit around the solar system.


There wouldn’t be enough fuel to recover from that. The window to reduce speed was now or never. 


The ship would become my coffin, an invisible comet flying eternally between the Oort Cloud and the Sun, every few hundred years passing close to home, only to disappear off into the darkness. 


My mind numb, I skipped the simulation forwards. The computer gave a 70% chance that, in around 20,000 years, a close encounter with Venus would eventually send my mummified remains into the Sun. 


George started to chuckle to himself. 


“Shut up, George. How the hell did you talk to my ship? Computer, advise how many lifeforms are aboard this ship.”


*”There are two lifeforms aboard the ship”*


George pushed himself across the cockpit and put a hand on my shoulder. “Don’t worry, so much time has passed on Earth since you’ve been gone, this might be a better fate, for all you know. Maybe the carbon capture programs failed, maybe the sea warmed even more. It might be hell down there!”


He leaned in to stare closely at the display. 


“Actually,” he muttered, “I take that back. No way the climate control systems can handle being that close to a yellow dwarf star. It’ll get pretty hot in here. That’s a horrible way to go.”


I ignored him. He was just a visual and auditory hallucination, a personification of my negative thoughts. There had to be an explanation for all of this. 


“Computer, is the second life-form inside the ship? Conduct a full scan of ship exterior.”


*”Exterior check complete. All lifeforms are currently aboard.”*


Nothing made sense. Any hull breach would have been detected. The only way a second lifeform could have boarded this ship is on Earth before it left. 


“Computer, when did the second lifeform board the ship?”


*”That data is not available.”*


“The computer was off, you really don’t remember, do you?”


My blood froze. George floated in front of me, a hint of a smile creeping across his face. 


“What was your wife’s name? Back on Earth? Why did you leave, knowing you wouldn’t return for centuries?”


I was still in shock, still processing the situation. My brain could barely process what he was asking me, let alone remember. 


“I...”


“She died,” George interrupted. “Do you remember her name? Her face? Do you remember your parents?”


“I... I’m in shock or something. I need to perform the velocity burn before it’s too...”


“What’s your NAME?” George snapped. “What does a sunrise look like? What does freshly cut grass smell like? What does love feel like?”


“George, I really need to...”


“WHAT. IS. YOUR. NAME.” George’s smile was gone. “You don’t even know what it’s supposed to be, do you? I’ll tell you. It’s George.


Your wife’s name was Bella. She died in a hurricane, along with your daughter. A sunrise looks like the burning hope of a new day. Freshly cut grass smells like childhood summers. Love feels like the universe suddenly makes sense.”


The holographic display was flashing now, warning that the next velocity burn was overdue. 


“COMPUTER, COMMENCE EMERGENCY FUEL DUMP.” George’s eyes were burning with rage, now. They glistened, as if he was holding back tears. 


*”Fuel dump underway”*


“What are you doing?” I screamed. “Computer, cancel fuel...”


“You don’t remember because it wasn’t you, it was me! I’m not imaginary. I’m an astronaut. MY name is George Ridley, and whatever the hell you are, you’re not making it down to Earth.”


I don’t remember much detail after that. It did get uncomfortably hot when we passed the Sun, and then very cold for a very long time. It gets hot every few hundred years on the return pass. 


George wasn’t imaginary, after all. Imaginary people don’t die, or decompose. I ejected him on the closest pass we made to Earth. It’s the least I could have done. 


I’m not sure what I am. Maybe a clone, or a shapeshifter, maybe I’M imaginary. I’ll never know. But he was right about me not being human. I’d have been long dead by now. 


I’m not sure how long I have to wait to die, but the computer still thinks I’ve got a good chance of hitting the sun in around 19,500 years. 


I do miss George, though.",1239,Nw5gooner,2023-04-29 07:12:01

Space is surprisingly empty. There's a reason it's not called 'full'. The ship's automation pretty much continues to do all of the fun stuff. Collecting data, scanning planets, searching for life. So far my job as a glorified maintenance man has culminated in a wildly exciting five minutes of clearing a rogue chunk of space rock from the main sensor. So much for my dreams of fame and renown as 'Captain Jefferies' of the U.S.S Pinkerton.

Day 233:
The computer won't talk to me anymore. I think I accidentally offended it. How was I to know it was sensitive about not having parents? The silence is deafening. I feel as though I'm becoming trapped within my own mind. Some days I wonder if space truly is just a lifeless void, echoing my loneliness back to me.

Day 355:
I made a friend today. The computer hasn't said a word in months. It's still functioning perfectly so I can only assume that is a personal choice. Luckily Bob is highly talkative. Turns out we have almost everything in common. He likes 90s pop punk just like me. His favourite movie is Armageddon. He hates reading (honestly why would you sit and read words when you could watch magic unfold in real time). He's the perfect guy.

Day 412:
Bob told me the best joke today. I daren't repeat it on the record but I was in stitches. I had to really try hard not to wet myself, the last thing I needed was trying to clean that up in zero g. He has such a good sense of humour. I have to say though, his smiles never quite seem to meet his eyes.

Day 590:
We should be returning to sub station 14 soon. Only a few more months to go. I asked Bob what he would do once we got home. His reply, ""I am home."". He's such a good friend. Almost like a brother to me at this point. Part of me worries that he will remain on the ship after the mission ends. I hope he will come with me though. I don't care what anyone says, he saved my life up here. I owe him.

Day 630:
Less than 100 days to go now. The time has really started to fly now that we're in the home stretch. Bob's gotten awfully quiet. We don't quite have as much fun together as we used to. I don't think he's looking forward to leaving. I think I'm going to ask him to come and live with me. He needs to know that the space he has filled will revert to a Bob sized hole in my heart if he leaves. 

Day 721:
We should have disembarked by now. Instead we've been put on indefinite hold by mission control. Bob seems nervous. I told him that everything will be fine. I wish I could convince myself. 

Day 730:
Mission control made contact today. ""We can't let you dock. We've got two life sign readings here,"" They told us. I tried to explain that it was because of both Bob and myself. They didn't understand though. They asked to speak to Bob but he was sleeping. I told them to try again tomorrow. 

Day 731: 
A shuttle approaches. They're coming. Bob betrayed me. I shouldn't have let him speak to mission control. It seems that they know him. Captain Bob Jefferies they called him. They asked lots of questions. He didn't tell them we were friends. He didn't explain how close we'd become. How we had saved each other. Instead he spoke lies of an alien entity commandeering his ship. Of being held hostage for most of the mission. Of me. 

Day 740:
Bob can't speak anymore. None of them can. They came to kill me. But nobody can kill me. I don't understand. I only came because of their message. They called for me. Asked for others to seek them out. I hear others calling now. A thousand voices from millions of lightyears away calling for signs of life. For proof they're not alone in an empty universe. 

Maybe I'll go and say hello.

""Stop.""

""Sweet home Alabama! Gonna fly this ship home to the docking venue!""

""*Stop.*"" I said again, losing patience. ""We need to focus."" The mission had been decades in the making and I wasn't prepared to end it as a skid-mark on a dying planets ass.

Wilson looked at me sideways, but still sang, albeit in a half-whisper. ""*Something something, skiddly diddly doo.*""

“Wilson, please!""

He went silent, but I could practically hear him continue the song mentally as his head bobbed to the beat. It was distracting as I tried inputting an intricate series of code into the holoscreen at my wrist.

I sighed, giving up on the task for a moment. ""You shouldn't be so excited, you know. Earth is a cesspool now. Filled with parasites. Humans, just sucking the life out of the planet.”

Wilson looked out the window dreamy-eyed. ""I can't *wait* to suck life out of the planet. You should try some."" He turned back to me. ""In the meantime, lighten up. It's a good day. You'll be home in minutes.""

""That's not my home,"" I said, and I meant it. The decades in deep-space had changed me. My ship's communications system had malfunctioned without reason or warning, stranding me alone in the deep black. Those years threatened to consume me entirely. I was lost, without hope, on the verge of self-termination, a failure to my people. Then came Wilson. It all changed with Wilson. He gave me the thing I needed most: guidance.

“So melodramatic,"" he said. ""What’s the first thing you’ll eat when you’re back?”

I shrugged. Food wasn’t on my mind.

""Come on. A burger? A pizza? *Two* burgers?""

""The first thing you said,"" I muttered, typing in a very precise set of codes.

“Churros for me. You like Churros?”

“Never had it.”

“Never had a churro!” Wilson exclaimed, looking at me with concern. “You know what a churro is though, right?”

“Yes.”

“What is it?”

“I need to focus.”

“On what? The ship does all the work,” he slapped the ship's controls clumsily. A light went on. “Whoops,” he flipped a switch and the light turned off. “See? Easy."" His eyes narrowed as he noticed what had been preoccupying me. ""What are you messing with on your wrist? A watch?”

“It's nothing,” I said. ""Tell me more about churros.""

It was as if I had asked him to tell me about his dead mother. He didn't stop talking for what felt like an hour, getting choked-up and teary-eyed at parts. It wasn't until the ship started shaking and roaring that he snapped back to the present. “And those notes of cinnamon and fried dough, they don't just go away. No, they linger both physically and mental--Wait! We’re through the atmosphere! This is it! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven–”

“Is that necessary?”

“Of course it's necessary! We're astronauts, we count-down! It's what we do! Three! Two! Oneeeee!” The ship continued decelerating and Wilson drew the syllables out as long as he could. ""Zeeeerrrooooooooo--""

With a roar, the ship shuddered to a stop. They had landed.

“Timed to a tee."" Wilson said. ""They'll shit themselves finding *two* of us in here, eh?""

“They’ll only find one of us,” I sighed, feeling almost guilty. But now that we had landed, I didn't need Wilson anymore. I pressed a button on what Wilson referred to as my ""watch.""

""Where'd you go?"" He said suddenly. Before he could say anything else, the ship’s doors opened and a crowd of armed men rushed in, clad head-to-toe in rubber. They ignored me and threw a metallic blanket over Wilson.

“What’s going on?!” I heard Wilson yell from underneath. The men had grabbed his arms and were escorting him from the ship.

“Lieutenant Wilson,” one of the men said. “Our readings indicated there was another life form on your ship. Probably microbial. We need to quarantine you.”

I smiled, and walked off after them.

And if there is another life-form, chances are it isn't with you in the cockpit but sticking to the hull or stowed away in some crack.""

As if the rough landing at sea after a deep space mission without human contact hadn't been enough.

Alix was aching for the warmth of human touch, a hug, a bright smile, a physical presence, away from buttons and cold steel. She withstood years of isolation with her favorite method, an imaginary and invisible friend she had built over the years with the manic precision of an author. The quirks, the mannerism, the dry humor. She named it Amdusias.

*Don't tell them. Please.*

She had her doubts when Amdusias showed more independence than an imaginary friend should. Mental stress was a risk of isolation, this could be a symptom, right? Right, but it was similar to a cancer patient differentiating the symptoms of a tumor and a cold.

""I see you,"" Alix once said out loud, alone in her cockpit.

Amdusias made itself discreet, an the extra effort to show how much of a product of Alix's imagination it was. This made Alix all the more suspicious.

""Enough fooling around, shall we?""

*Fine, fine.* 

Thus, she got properly introduced to Amdusias. The parasite nesting at her core that would have taken hold of its host, but there had been... complications.

*I didn't know I liked stories. You taught me how to.*

Instead of feeding on Alix's consciousness, Amdusias ate at her fantasy. And her fantasy shaped Amdusias in turn. The parasitic link became symbiotic, Amdusias took shape and character, Alix found a friend and sanity in the depths of space.

Of course, now came the return to earth. There had been no such things as bio-scanners when Alix left.

""Maybe I should use the occasion to be rid of you?"" whispered Alix.

*We named stars that no waking eye has seen, we witnessed red dwarfs die and crumble upon themselves. We followed the reflections of a galaxy until it vanished and were present for the wonders born to fill the void. You taught me names and philosophy, I showed you how to rediscover the air you breathe and the world before your eyes. And besides. You wouldn't forgive yourself for killing the imaginary friend you created.*

""This could make me go down in history.""

*Go on, I dare you.*

No anger in Amdusias' thoughts, they both knew what the other wanted and would do. This was a way to psych themselves up after the decision to keep Amdusias hidden.

""Be silent.""

Scanners, medical check-ups, psychological questioning, more tests.

""I don't get it,"" said the doctor, ""the scanners keep marking you as... well, different, but that makes little sense. Everything else came green.""

""I spent years in deep space doc. Is that enough for me to be considered different by that thing?""

""Could be. Or we can just scrap the machine and be done with it.""

Weird, but hell, nothing else had come out of Alix's surveillance for the many days it lasted. 

And so, after reports, handshakes and congratulations, Alix was released to the world and to a much needed anonymity after the onslaught of attention.

Officially, it was rest. Alix had picked a cabin on a beach in the Caribbeans, but despite her need for recovery, she was already on yet another grand task. Discover what the world is when two beings watch through the same pair of eyes.

*There's more than eyes. There is flesh, there is sensation.*

Alone in her cabin, or as alone as a parasite could allow, Alix picked a kitchen knife. 

*You showed me lots, Alix, I am grateful. I'd like you to understand my nature. Parasites you understand, I latch to a host and eat at them from inside. But you're not merely food and a way for me to move through space. I've eaten and inhabited beings that could scarcely be considered as made of flesh, or tangible. Still I latched, and ate. There is this thing you call art, creation for the sake of creation, beauty removed from self-preservation.*

Alix planted just the tip in her forearm, slowly, she carved up to the elbow.

*I have only ever seen sustenance and survival. I can scarcely tell you what counts as a good painting or music. But I know to play with my food. And you happen to be made of food.*

The pain was deafening, greater than what the thin red line should have provoked. 

*Think of it as ripple effect. A sportsman will hurt himself a little by lifting weights, to grow more muscular down the line. A little pain for greater benefits. Physiotherapist will do it too, surgeons to a greater extent. This is simply the same logic brought to an extreme.*

Had Alix air left, she would scream. Alas, her lungs were empty. Skin and capillaries was spreading out like four thin wings, and what Alix saw in the mirror was both terrifying and beautiful.

She slept the entire day. Shaping flesh was exhausting art.

*And there's another problem.*

There was. It was the main argument in favor of ratting out Amdusias to the doctors. It was a parasite, hungry, and fatally, Alix's imagination would run out one day.

*It's my nature.*

A long life without her imaginary yet real friend, or a short life, never alone. She had chosen.

*Astronauts aren't known for fatalism now, are they?* 

No. Alix had picked a third option.

Oh hell no. And Alix had an idea she played with for quite some time. 

Away from her sanctuary on the beach there was a city. Like every good city, there was a less than shiny underbelly to it. And Alix, a lone woman, was a prime target when she walked the rough streets at night.

But they didn't know about Amdusias, oh no. A large shape blocked Alix's path one evening.

The shape, the man, disappeared from the face of the earth that same evening. As did the next fool who thought her an easy target. 

It wouldn't be long until rumors spread like wildfire, about a syndicate cleaning town, about crazed murderers devouring their victims. About monsters and legends.

*Took a long time to find a fitting candidate.*

Indeed. Physically fit, a brain of acceptable proportions, no obvious sign of sickness or intellectual weakness, a surprisingly vivid imagination. But a new host would simply push the problem away without solving it, and Alix would lose easy access to Amdusias should the man prove unruly.

*Unless...*

Nights upon nights, they worked. Alix opened her flesh to offer the world, closed it again with lessons learned. She saw deeper through the body on the table, was connected through marrow and skin as each vein was properly placed, each fiber repurposed, the body remade as needed. 

Bones breaking, molded, carved, muscles like wax, the spine like steel wires.

Alix passed out from exhaustion. 

When she woke up, she heard only silence. No soothing presence, only hollowness like a screaming void.

The cabin was empty, Alix's presence made it emptier still. She ran out.

""The sea, the sand,"" said the man, ""quite the experience to feel it alone.""

""For a moment there, I thought I lost you,"" said Alix.

""Oh no, not me. What do we do now?""

""Anything we want Amdusias, anything we want.""",134,Ataraxidermist,2023-04-29 06:58:44

But this chap at mission control won't let me off the ship until they finished inspection. Unidentified lifeform has been detected on my ship, they tell me.

Nonsense, I'm the only living being on this ship. I'm pretty sure this imaginary friend I've been chatting with in my head is just that. An imaginary friend in my head. Okay, I confess, I crafted a doll out of spare parts because it's easier to have an actual physical presence to talk to. Makes me feel a little less crazy to talk to a face, even if it's just a metal doll.

A man named Captain Morgan steps out of the mission control tower and calls for a search team. I take a deep breath and do my best to compose myself. During that strange meteor storm, I was very sure I cleaned out any vaguely strange organisms who crawled in through the small tear in the ship's hull and repaired the damage completely. There shouldn't be any loose ends.

After a few hours of scanning every nook and cranny of my ship and finding no signs of an additional lifeform, the search team hauls me off for questioning in an isolated room. I am prepared, I have done my homework and anticipated the kinds of questions I would face when I reach Earth. They take notes and step outside for a long discussion, leaving me in the room all alone, waiting with bated breath. A few members of the security team enter the room and wave a strange sort of machinery I've never seen all around me.

It beeps.

One of the men apologizes for what they are about to do to me. I am stripped naked, probed for alien parasites, then sent off to a cubicle to be disinfected just in case.

Finally, the security team apologizes again for the false alarm and hand me a fresh set of clothes and the keys to a locker and bedroom in the space station. I'm finally in.

Lying in the freshly laid-out bed in the room, I send a message to my commander. The first part of my mission is successful.

It was a very close call, but none of these humans seem to suspect that I had fully assimilated that human astronaut who foolishly thought I was just some imaginary friend in his head.",68,Tregonial,2023-04-29 07:22:10

Once upon a time this street was something beautiful. A pair of flower shops on the corner made war through their bouquets: tumbles of wild columbines and snapdragons on one side of the street, sheafs of hothouse roses carefully arranged on the other. And there were all the usual restaurants and other upper middle class affectations. Candle shops and the like. Now old men and drunks stamped through the streets, babbling.   
He said: “I don’t talk to her anymore. I promise. But I do hear her voice. It’s like lemon peels, you know. This warm, fresh zest, but not so violent that you’d remember it. More like it’s hanging there somewhere in your subconscious, unmistakable. And maybe you could claw it back but why? Why bother?  
“I’m babbling,” the old man said.   
And in his head he supplied the word: “*Yes*.”   
“It’s just a habit,” he continued. “Just something that I picked up from the stars. Like the pox. Ensign Gaunt got it off a brothel Alpha Cen before we left and refused to let Doc Caldwell diagnose it. Embarrassed. Said it didn’t matter, it’s not like it would kill him. And it didn’t, did it? When we pulled him out of his pod at the end he was all shriveled up and mummified. Dehydration. Turned out that when the engines blew they severed the water line to his cabin. Well. When I pulled him out, I guess. I suppose I was the only man-jack left.  
“Damn,” he said. “Damn, damn, damn. I’m babbling.”   
And the wind blew steadily on.   
The man was forty; not old, not really. But he had the kind of deep-lined, solemn face that ages you. Wrinkled eyes were set above a wide, and tight lipped mouth. Again, once upon a time, that mouth would have been called expressive. Now it was curtained by a two week growth of ragged beard. He spat, and ran a hand through greasy hair. The wind picked up again, whisking down the street to hurl newsprint and thrown out magazines. He stumped past a burnt out clothing shop, a bustling bar, the stove in window of a candle store, with one hollow eyed young woman browsing the swept-clean shelves. *Lemon peel*, the old man thought. He continued on.   
“I’m imagining a doctor’s office,” he said. “White walls, beige couches. Posters on the walls that say utterly inconsequential things. Like the one they took me to after we—*I*—landed. Out in Houston. It was a gorgeous day, and I was staring at it through the window. I hadn’t seen trees in quite a while and there was this scrubby mesquite. Ugly little thing, but it was prettier than the questions he was asking me. The doctor. Therapist, I guess they say.”  
Up ahead, a streetlight flickered on. That was rare in these parts and so the old man looked up, wondering for a moment if the bad dreams had ended. In that moment, streetlights seemed like the prime harbinger of civilization. He remembered New York as a boy, darting from puddle to puddle as the day melted into shadow and the streetlights flickered on, his mother’s voice calling after him from the front stoop. Through all of his long walk the only lights the old man had seen had burned in the windows of the bars. Harsh fluorescents, they’d terrible things to the faces that he’d seen there. Pooling in sunken eyes and highlighting rotten teeth. *Last call,* the old man thought, approaching that one flickering streetlight and the figure hunched beneath it. *Last call for planet Earth...*  
He was still several blocks away. Still babbling, still thinking. *I’m imagining a doctor’s office.* And why not? Imagination had gotten him into this mess, perhaps it would get him out. But no; even now, aged and stooped and walking with a cane, he knew with a young man’s strong-backed certainty that it would not.  
He said: “I called her Mabel. Stupid name. People aren’t called Mabel anymore. They don’t even name *cows* that. But I was floating there, alone, and the years were bleeding by and I’d already buried Ensign Gaunt and Doc Caldwell and the others. So when she came to me—in a dream, I swear, just a dream!—I spoke to her. Any man would, a voice like that. And we talked of summer in New York, and school holidays on Luna, and if her descriptions were perhaps eccentric, well. I wasn’t one to judge. Because I’d needed the company, see? Any man would have talked to her as I did. Told her secrets. Let her in.”   
Another step just like all the others, but this time his cane slipped and the old man crashed down to one knee, the impact rattling his teeth and hollow bones. He spat, tasting blood. He’d spent the better part of the last ten years in space, talking to Mabel. Trading stories, hopes, and dreams. An invaluable friendship. Her soft presence at his side as he repaired the engines—always thinking it was impossible, that this was the day he would give up and die, cut off the water like poor Gaunt and let himself drift away on the hot, recycled air. But he never did. And day after day after day she spoke to him in a kind of seamless waking dream, stepping out of his nights like a saint or angel. Barefoot, walking the long emptiness of the spaceship’s halls with nary a whisper. No scents except those which his mind supplied—and if they were particularly vivid, what then?   
*Lemon peel,* the old man thought again. She’d worn nightdresses and shapeless gowns, and he’d fixed the stars in her black hair.  
She’d kissed him when he finally repaired the engines. And what had that tasted like? How sweet...  
He pushed away the memory and the pain in his knee and stumped on up the street.   
*I’m imagining a doctor’s office,* the old man thought, *because it was imagination that got me into this mess. And because it was the greatest shock I ever had when they sat me dead and said—*   
“Mabel?”   
The old man looked up. He was at the streetlight. There was another person there, another man. A boy, really, with the wide, guileless eyes and seamless face of seventeen. Once upon a time he would have been trying to sneak into the bars, but now he just stood curled against the lamppost, the black grime from the metal smeared across one sallow cheek.   
“Mabel?” the boy said again. “Is that you?” Then he turned as if pulled by a string to stumble out of the fading light, slouching off into the distance. The boy was barefoot, crunching through the broken glass. He left bloody footprints in his wake.   
And the old man shivered for a time before stumping on. He was headed up the street to home. An apartment that they’d found for him before everything began to bleed away. Because in that doctor’s office, white walls, beige couches—such idiotic posters!—they’d looked at him and said*, “Dean, we need you to focus, this is important. We have someone—some*thing *in custody. Dean, who is Mabel?”*   
*It was a dream*, the old man thought. Or it should have been. He’d been alone before he left, and sometimes beautiful women had seemed further away than the most distant stars. Simpler to believe that she never had been real at all and kinder too, to think that those long nights laboring to fix the engines had been just another fantasy. A harmless bit of imagination. Madness, if it came to that. Anything was better than intention.   
He left the streetlight far behind him. There was another bar ahead, there always was. Bars were the only places still doing business, even though they weren’t making alcohol anymore. Nobody paid, people just walked in and took a seat and drank whatever they were given. As if by some collective delusion, they had all agreed it was time for giving up.   
The old man stopped. This was his street, his corner. There on the right was the flower shop with its shriveled columbines and wilted snapdragons. Its enemy across the way was crumbling already, the hothouses roses had not survived. Only in the window beside him, those last, dying snapdragons, were a few faint echoings of blue.   
He heard a voice. Like lemon peels, fresh and warm, sweet and low, every old cliche that a man might say about a woman.   
She stepped out from the wreckage of the flower shop garbed in shadows. A long and shapeless gown that trailed behind her. Dark hair and pale skin, a smile on full lips.   
“Mabel?” said the old man. And his cane fell from his hand, echoing in the street.

All alone, in a dark vacuum, protected from certain death by just the metal construction that carries you through it. You can try and imagine it. Emptiness, black void dotted with stars and planets. You can see yourself drifting through it. You can try to imagine yourself being lonely, the same kind of loneliness you experience when none of your friends are available. Or maybe a deeper kind of loneliness. The existential kind that makes you want to give up on life, and if that is you – don’t give up, it will get better. Feelings – no matter how good or bad – are always temporary. That said, space warps your mind in a way that is simply not the same. The way you respond to being confronted by something bigger than your mind can comprehend, something that can kill you without care or even noticing. It’s Lonely, but it makes you appreciate life, rather than give up on it.

That said, it’s pretty darn lonely of the familiar kind as well. I can tell you that while floating around in my space pod, doing all kinds of seemingly meaningless experiments. Who give a damn whether lettuce grows without gravity?

“I Do.”

“Yeah, I know you do. That’s why I keep doing it.”

It’s been a rough six months. Space trips with fellow astronauts never seem to take as long – even though they did. But conversing with others made time fly by, conversing with yourself only reminded you of the monotony of what you were doing. Monotony has to be a concept designed by some higher power with a very crude idea of humor. Now where did I leave that mister? I’m sure I locked it in place right there, but apparently it had decided not to follow the constraints of how I remembered it. This happened more and more often. You’re probably smart, you’ve read what isolation can do to a human mind. That’s probably what’s happening here, I’m going right mad. Knowing that doesn’t help me find where I misplaced that damned mister, though.

“It’s over there.”

“Ah, thank you”

Did lettuce need water in space? Why wasn’t that an experiment. Instead of torturing that poor plant by making it grow the old fashioned way under new fashioned circumstances. Well – buddy – here’s your water nonetheless, as I opened the hatch at the back of the growth chamber and sprayed a good five sprays in the container. The water would find a way to the plant eventually, or the plant to the water, as if that mattered much.

Now, you’re probably wondering who I am and what I’m doing here? I’m Zachariah Jones, you can call me Jones. It had always been my dream to fly to outer space, ever since I was very little. It had been my parents dream to raise me as a good little Christian boy and push me into the clergy. Guess you can say that I won. Even if space turned out to be really boring once the novelty wears off. It probably still beats sitting in a box listening to terrible people begging for forgiveness from an uncaring God, if there was such a thing as a God at all. I used to be pretty sure there wasn’t, but space threw enough weirdness at you to make anyone stop being really sure of themselves. Still, space didn’t give a damn about sacks of bones, blood and skin being self aware, so why would a God?

Luckily there was someone who cared about this sack of carbon based matter.

“Yes, that’s you. Now stop gawking.”

You’re wondering who I’m talking to, since this was supposed to be a solo mission? Myself, mostly. It’s as much myself as clipped toenails are I suppose. It originated from myself, from my brain being so bored by a lack of input, that it created an input machine all on its own. Don't even need to throw a quarter in it to make it do something. That, or my ship has been infiltrated by some nefarious invisible space monster that can cross outer space without the need of oxygen or any form of protection and entered my ship through holes so tiny that air can’t escape. A creature that – once arrived – found my company so compelling that it decided to hang around and keep me company and only resorting to mild annoyances  – like misplacing objects  – instead of draining my corpse dry of sweet sweet fluids. Like that would ever happen.

So, it has been a couple of months where me and my imagination role-played our way to the end of our journey. Soon we’d be arriving back into orbit and once cleared we can finally leave this mildly over expensive vegetable garden behind us and settle into a quiet and normal life among the rest of Earths population. I’m still pretty certain that the church isn’t meant for me, but god I could use some peace and quiet. The kind you experience within the anonymity of city life, where everyone’s there, but no one cares. I might even grow some lettuce in a way that wasn’t akin to torturing it.

“When do you think we’ll arrive?”

“Couple of hours, why do you care? Not like you’ll be around for much longer.”

And so we waited. The problem with floating through space is that you have no real way to get a feel for how much time has passed. The sun is always there and there could be the same place, or somewhere else, but it moved so much that you just stopped trying to use it as a reliable measurement. So when ground control finally contacted us it came as a surprise, despite actively waiting for its sweet release.

“Ground control for Jones, ground control for Jones, over.”

“Finally, took you long enough. Over, thank you very much.”

“We’ll initiate scans and after you’re cleared you’re free to initiate landing protocol. Over.”

“Yeah, yeah. Do whatever it is you guys do. Over.”

Scanning would take only a minute. You could follow the procedure on the screen in the control panel. So you’d be updated in real-time on the confirmation of your lonesome existence. It had something melancholic about it, the validation that your mind played tricks on you, just because it pitied you.

“You think it’ll pick up on me?”

“What a weird question, why would it? You’re me.”

The progress bar on the screen suddenly stopped and started flashing red.

“Great, now what?”

Stupid technology. Smart enough to send me into space, but not smart enough to differentiate between lettuce and alien life forms, apparently.

“Ground control for Jones, Ground control for Jones. Alien matter detected, I repeat, alien matter detected. Can you confirm? Over.”

“Confirm what? It’s just me and the plants dammit. Just get me home. Over, fuck!”

“You’re forgetting me.”

“You’re just a figment of my imagination, those don’t count.”

The bar disappeared from the control screen and a face appeared in its place. A human face, of someone seemingly as annoyed about this whole standard procedure taking away precious time spend not following needless safety protocols. This fact at least gave some comfort. Not being alone in your mild inconvenience always felt that tiny bit better than not sharing it with someone else.

“Parker from ground control here. Over.”

“Yes, Parker. Please just get over with the necessities so I can go home. Over.”

“Hello Parker, nice to meet you!”

To everyone's surprise Parker's face turned from somewhat bored to very much in panic.

“Jones, behind you! What is that?”

“What do you mean, behind me?”

I turned around only to face my imagination staring back at me. That’s when it sunk in.

“Yes. I knew I was smarter than that. My brain feeling sorry for me, what was I thinking. You’re not toenails, you’re real!”

“Now when do you think we’ll arrive on that planet of yours?”

The light here is generous, and radiates so sharply that the shadows of the valley tops looked as if they were ancient pastoral figures gazing down over some hazard upon their flock. It was here in this plain that they said that life was a possibility. Good wind, heat, and water. Plenty economy to live on as any god loving place on Earth. If she had been here to see it she might have called on us to cordon off some corner of the land for ourselves. Thank god. Before I left they said if it was my wits that would carry the last embers of man then it was her ambition that would rake the flames. Yesterday marks fourteen years since and perhaps that is the last good memory of the spoken word that I can recall. We now communicate through a series of electronic clicks and jitters for a purpose I no longer remember or care to ask. They just tell me what to do. Some sort of geothermal bacteria thriving in those open portals to hell. It will be a short stop they said.

I lowered myself out of the lander and patted the satchel for the thermos that I had just put in. I am no sane man, but I am a prepared one. I took a hop and then another one to get myself to speed and finally gathered my confidence to continue. It would be a thirty minute walk. If the world was watching a broadcast of myself I would have said a couple of kind words for the Coca Cola company and talked about a dream of Hawaii. The former from my wit and the latter from her fire. As I walked towards those two lids in the dirt I could not help but notice how the remoteness did not disturb me as much as I thought it would. Walking here was lighter, but not much different mechanically as walking at home. The solar reflections off the ground were bright, but not much brighter than the reflections of light off of the pavement in a city. There were stars here, just as on Earth. Man was here, just as on Earth.

It was not long before I arrived at the pools and found them steaming with heat. The ground at the rims was charred brown and sulfuric and the water a deep blue. I paced the perimeter of one taking note of its depth and features and then did the same for the other. You could have guessed that they were some ancestor of those pools from Yosemite, and I would have agreed. From the corner of my eye I noticed a shade of pink at a patch of water just a pace away. How fortunate for humanity to not be so alone. I quickly made my way to the edge of the pool and knelt down feeling for the thermos. It was clear that the patch was of some organized matter, far more complex than what dim matter existed elsewhere in this lonely universe. How great it would be to get this under the microscope. In one motion I held the thermos under the pink surface with tongs. The water first swirled, then bubbled, and finally gulped to a stillness. As I pulled it out and swirled on the cap I looked upwards in the direction of the lander and saw a silhouette beside it. There you are. She motioned to her wrist, and I looked at mine. Shot past thirty going on fifty. No bueno. In an urgent pace I jogged along the surface kicking up what dust and silt that was there that I had not trodden on. It wasn’t long before I was back before the lander and she was there.

“Sorry, have you been waiting long?”

Just since you left.

“That’s not too bad then. I’m hungry.”

It’s because you don’t eat much.

“My appetite saves food.”

Yeah but it’s not saving you. You’ve lost weight.

“I know. Unloaded you.”

Sharp.

“There’s that smile. Get in. ”

Whatddya want to talk about today?

“The same thing we always do.”

Okay.

The flight back to Earth was straightforward and time was blended between the conversations. I can’t recall the order that we conversed but we spoke of California and hamburgers. We talked about if the kid would be alright and she thought it crude of him to try to make it in the east. We talked about retirement and maybe a career in politics. That’s what they do - the astronauts. We talked about what we thought they would say when they saw me and what I thought I would say when they did. Would the weather be the same? It’d be a little hotter, she said. I think it would be gusty too. What’d the property get rented to? That boy from Stanford. It’s nice, it has wind breaks. I think it’s a shame, I love the wind.

Just between the Earth and the moon the communications display beeped and clicked which translated to “AUX ON”. I looked around the console between various arrays of switches until I found it and clicked it upwards. A shattering of noise and static filled the cabin until the fourteen year drought was broken.

“Houston to Cap”

“Cap. Go ahead.”

“How have you been Cap?”

Tears.

“Cap?”

“Well the food sucked but I’ve never felt more alive.”

“That’s our hero. Well we’re happy to have you back. We’re all waiting. You excited?”

“Excited can’t even the describe the feeling. I can’t wait for a burger.”

“Alright. Before you get down here can you state the souls on board?”

“One.”

“One? Don’t you mean two?”

“What’s that?”

“Don’t you remember? Look around?”

I gazed over my shoulder towards the rear consoles and saw nothing. I turned the other way and saw it.

“Oh yeah, that’s right. Two souls on board.”

“We thought so. Bravo Cap, bravo. See you soon.”

“Can’t wait to get it under a microscope.”

By that afternoon the navy had retrieved the capsule from the ocean. They kept me in a clean room for a week, and then released me to my folk. The days of my reintegration was smoother than expected. Everything tasted so sweet and the colors of earth were much more vibrant than I had remembered. One night as I drove on a desert road between relative homes I swore the night sky burned with millions of comets. She was sitting next to me and began to recall that they had not burned as bright out there than they did in the cabin of this car. I held her hand and thanked her for coming as far as she did with me to places that I did not think that I could go. If I had lost my wit, then it was her fire that kept me here. She just smiled and said it was alright.

I don’t believe in fate but I do feel like the universe waits for the right time to tell you things. I don’t believe it, but I feel that way sometimes. That day I never saw her again, but I still tell people about her and the things she liked and didn’t. Ever since I have walked the good Earth as she had wanted me to. Good wind, heat, and water.",9,mt_Wakefield,2023-04-29 11:26:38

“Ah finally! I can return home!”

“Boy I can’t wait to meet your friends! We’re gonna have so much fun!”

“Hehe, yeah. Oh, something is comin.” The astronaut turns on a screen. “Aye! Been a month since I last saw ya Tiff!”

“Hi. I’m sorry but we don’t have time for chitchat. There is an unidentified life form on Cruiser J-12.” 

“What?”

“We just picked up a heat signature in your shuttle, it’s in your garden.”

“Wait hold on! I haven’t even been anywhere close to some planet! No alien could’ve hopped on. Are you sure your readings are accurate?”

“We’ve double, triple, quadruple checked everything. We hopes it’s just a bug. But, we can’t let you come back until you confirm this is incorrect. Alright?”

“Alright.”

“Over & out.” She signs off. The astronaut then makes his way to the garden.

“Oh no! Am I not gonna be able to meet your friends! I had just prepared my famous moon pie!”

“Don’t worry Sticky, we’ll get there soon, I just have to prove there isn’t anything on this ship.” The astronaut grabs a camera. “Alright.” He then opens up a door & goes inside to look around at the garden, a room full of tomatoes & beans, along with some other plants to eat. He looks around, pulling plants aside & scanning around with the camera. “Ha! I knew it! Nothing here!”

“You sure are smart Tod!”

“Thank you Sti- what the?” Tod finds the camera beeping with a red light flashing. “Warm blood?” He then looks around. Nothing but plants. He then looks at the screen to see 2 dots. Him & another right in front of him. He looks forward. Just a tomato plant. 

“Hey Tod, I bet that things malfunctioning too! We should head back!”

“Well... we can’t be too sure.” He then points the camera to the tomato plant to find a giant dark purple tendril creature sucking the tomato’s dry. “What the fuck?!”

“It must be a malfunction with the camera! Stupid technology!”

“No! This isn’t a malfunction!” He looks again. Still there. He removes the camera only to find nothing there. 

“We should head back!”

“I’m, don’t worry Sticky.” He then reaches out, while also looking into the camera. He then touched the creature. It suddenly emits a gas.

“Get back!” Sticky pulls Tod away. 

“What the?!”

“Let’s go! Come on!”

“Wha?! But what about?!” Sticky pulls Tod away from the creature & out of the Garden. 

“Remove the oxygen!”

“What?”

“Remove the fucking oxygen in the room!”

“Ok!” Tod then clicks on some keys near the door, causing oxygen to being slowly removed from the room. “What is that?”

“It’s not important, we should go!”

“Go where?!” Sticky pulls Tod over to the control station.

“Away from Earth!”

“Why?! What’s going on?!”

“We didn’t kill it! We failed!” Tod & Sticky then sit down in their chairs & start to steer the ship away from Earth. 

“Failed?!”

“But it’s ok! You have me! You always had me!”

“Wait... did I?”

“Yes! & it’s all gonna be ok! We can play cards, eat Moon Pie, & watch Sticky & Friends!”

“...yeah, yeah. It’s not that bad... I bet we’ll meet some better friends outside in space!”

“Yeah! Let’s go onto another adventure! Season 2, Sticky & Tod search the stars!”

“Yeah! Alright! I’m up for it!” The space ship flies far away from Earth & out into the stars. 

Back at message control, Tiff is looking at her screen along with some other people. She then dials Tod & tries to contact him. “Tod! What the fuck are you doing!”

“I’m going for an adventure that’s what!”

“What? Adventure? Are you out of your mind?!”

“Hehehehe! Yeah! I think I am! I mean, I was crazy enough to believe I could kill those things & come back home!”

“Kill? Things?”

“It doesn’t matter! It never mattered! I’m gonna spare you guys the trouble & go off onto an adventure of my own for once! I’ll make sure to send back post cards. Over & out!”

“Wait!” Tod hangs up. People look around, wondering what to do. Tiff begins to panic. But back on the space ship, Tod is having the time of his life looking at all the stars as Sticky begins to type down a message on screen. [Don’t enter this ship. We made the same mistake with another. They won’t leave. If you do decide to enter this ship, do what we do. Fly far far away from Earth. As far as you can.] Sticky finished typing & joined Tod.
