4,4,3,4,4,4,"There was a certain charm to playing a long line of eccentric nobles over the years. Shuffling wealth down the 'lineage' of my 'descendants' was simple once you knew how unscrupulous humans were and the ones who knew how to weave through the intricate web of taxation and usury were the best ones who with a wink found a way to move money here or there.

At first, it was in elaborate paintings. Give me a lilting sunset, or a noon basking over a farm field, I would ask. I sighed as each artwork propped itself up after a master of their craft gave me the best rendition of what that fiery orb in the sky looked liked.

Pale imitations of what really existed over my head when I slept.

I then tried to peer into the telescopes of great astrologers and astronomers, only to learn that I grew bored watching things too distant for me to reach.

Next, rotoscopes and movie films equally tried my attention; as cinema was for entertainment, not active participation. I did chuckle at what they thought my kind was like. A sad, tragic but true take of the real thing...

I was so close when computers came alive and from simple pixels to living canvasses stretched across a 3D ceiling, it became alluringly close to what I hungered for. The first games that truly showed me a living ball of searing energy took my breath away.

But it was not quite right. Something was missing. That was until I found an emergent technology that was being worked on in Japan.

I spared no expense. There was a genius to the idea, and I wanted to ensure that it grew, not devolve itself into a plaything for the uninspired and the insipid.

I flipped the visor in my hand. It was truly a marvel of technology. Instant access points to any connection locally, total immersion, and near synaptic processing speeds of data.

Most of the terms flew over my head, but what it offered, I could not deny. Donning it like a helmet, it would allow me access to a world in which it didn't matter who I was, I would be able to see, to sense, to feel what was denied to me for centuries. A yearning I had missed when the last mortal sunset I saw doomed me to be a creature of the night.

Until now.

And all it costed was a pittance of years, an ungodly amount of fortune, and perhaps ten thousand mortal souls.

For I looked over at the man who invented this complex neurological interface. His thin smile, behind that uninspired face, belied a man who valued humans as much as I did. I made a deal with him to build me a world that I could walk in the daylight. And from the handshake we traded, despite my superior strength that I could snap him in half if I so choose, I saw the same being who yearned for something beyond his grasp too- a world that he could exist in as well. A world that would cost anything and everything to make.

He nodded to me, indicating it was ready to wear.

I smiled, a crack that my visage hadn't borne in a good century.

A suitable name for a vampire, as she was not only separated from the living but despite the whole being dead thing, held a irrepressible fire inside.

She had just gotten back from another night's trip to her local mall, her only real social interaction to the outside world, she had many off comments, some complimenting her for her coal black hair or her ghostly skin, some on her strange and mysterious lifestyle. Either way, they never lasted.

She talks to the cashier, a young man, Diablo with a direction less yet optimistic outlook on life who is pretty much the only person she regularly sees, after wasting countless nights on the internet, which had became her definition of a public life she had been convinced to purchase a odd new game.

After a conversation she had already hid away she returned to her singular home and decided to plug it in, ""Atleast I'll have some sort of life"" She says to herself, with a defeated grin. After some loading time the game begins and she is struck by a overwhelming emotion as if it was a rapid uppercut to the head. For the first time in the entire month she felt truly awake and held a gaping expression on her face, she didn't know why she felt this way, but she wanted to find out how.

As she continued playing she sees things that had faded away long ago. She starts to see a world, become part of a story, instead of a looming shadow from a abounded pack. She felt a sense of achievement and a odd sense of community, she started to see the light. ""What's this?"" She asks herself, embarrassed as soon as the words came out. ""The giant ball of radiation that floats over in the sky. What people call the sun"" She bluntly responds, before holding in a fit of luaghter.

At first it was merely amusing, as time went on she became invested, as the night turned into day and the day turned into night she had became addicted, in a strangely healthy way. For the first time in a decade, she had finally felt 'happiness' not the fleeting type of a random compliment on the street or a short reward, but something more fulfilling. As if she had finally discovered something she had always needed. Soon her catalogue of games started to build up & she beat them all. She smiled, she laughed, she may have even lived.

As she kept on gaming she decides to try it online and very soon she had found people talk to as well. Maybe life was more than survival. Maybe joy didn't go away with a soul and maybe, just maybe.. video game good.",j90nocp,0,Human,Human-Novice,Human-Novice,6,45.04010725021362
4,4,3,4,4,4,"Do you know what it tastes like when someone dreams of their family, the happy times they spent together, the happy times that could be?

It tastes like warm soup on a cold night.

A dream of a passionate night spent with a crush? It's like a bowl of fruit, freshly cut and mixed to perfection with perhaps just a hint of spice to it. A killer dreaming of a fresh victim? It's like steak, strangely familiar yet unique, juicy, savoury, and bloody.

I've travelled the cosmos for hundreds of years, feeding on the dreams of the different races I've come across. Some simpler and less developed; their dreams are quaint and straightforward, like eating an apple without anything else. Some developed; those dreams are like fine meals with several courses, each more refined than the rest. Do not think me cruel; the worst I can do is cause a dreamless night to sate my hunger.

And then there's humanity.

I have never, ever, tasted anything like what humanity has offered.

There's plenty to be had like what I had described; savoury and sweet, sour and pleasantly bitter. Some of the dishes they have offered ranked among the highest I've ever had. But then I would come across something entirely new; a dream that has been twisted and broken beyond my comprehension; a dream that brings no comfort or rest; a dream they call ""a nightmare"".

I have... seen things of pure, unbridled terror with no sense or reason. An infinite fall filled with a neverending scream echoing through the empty void. A monster of impossible composition preying on the human as they frantically search for safety, never to find it. The sensation of being at their most vulnerable at the worst of moments. It's wrong.

And it's something only they have. I pity them. The idea that you might seek rest and refreshment only to experience terror untold and wake up screaming... nothing in the galaxy should ever experience that.

Do you know what a nightmare tastes like?

No, you don't.

And you don't want to.",inbvq5e,1,Human,Human-Advanced,Human-Advanced,1200,43.73994421958923

Their desperate squirms only tightening the surrounding webbing, making it so it was nearly impossible for them to breathe. Each breath only straining their lungs until they felt like their body might pop from holding in all that oxygen. They went to scream, but the noise refused to come out, leaving them trapped in their nightmarish hell.

Even as their three stomachs growled, Xai couldn't eat. They were too enthralled by the nightmare, wondering how it would end. They watched as a sixteen-legged spider crawled out of a hole. Their body being four times the size of the human with two piercing fangs protruding from their mouth. Each fang dripping a greenish venom that was dripping onto the ground below, burning holes inas they tossed and turned uelieved them of the nightmare, sucking the dream up. The purple energy leaving the human's ears, slowly drifting into Xai's skin as the alien dined on their dream. As soon as the dream left their mind, the human stopped stirring, loosening their grip on their blankets as they returned to their peaceful slumber.

Even after being fed, Xai couldn't leave the human's side, still trying to work out what they had just seen. Dreams were just a mind's way of breaking down the information it had processed, right? Then was this something the human had experienced before? In all their studies about Earth, they had never come across a spider big enough to trap a human in such a way. Did they still not understand the planet?

Xai tookthat appeared rather mundane. This made sense. This dream was the perfect examplehat had happened over the day. So, if this dream made sense, where did the spider come from? The concept of a nightmare not crossing the alien's mind. A nightmare made little sense. In a galaxy of dreamers, they had never encountered something so strange. The idea that the mind would sabotage itself, leaving Xai rather confused. All it did was make the alien pity the human. Their eight fingered hand brushing the cheek of the human, trying to offer them some comfort.

The human only turned away, rolling over in their sleep to escape the icy touch. When the human moved away, the alien gave them space, leaving them to their sleep. Xai still didn't know what to make of the nightmare they had seen, but they were determined to discuss it with their kind.

Within the four stone walls sat a single wooden door and a shuttered window. A large black pot hung in the fire place above slowly dying embers.

A feeling of satisfaction began to fill the invader. Suddenly, a feeling of pure unbridled ecstasy filled its entire being. The human below began to squirm, shiver and sweat, unable to truly move with the creature standing on top of it.

Never had a feeling such as this been felt. Where it would have normally stopped before the awakening, this hunger could not be satiated. As more sustenance filled it's being the creature began to pull on its tendrils as though trying to force it or urging it onward.

4,4,4,5,5,4,"I finished my speech, fully prepared for the usual spectacle of protests and outrage. I take no pleasure in those but centuries of analysis and prosperity proved our way as superior and most efficient.

However cruel it is.

I certainly didn't expect this unusual noise the humans started producing. It took my communications specialist the long Earth minute to identify and then confirm the noise as ""cheering"".

Were these humans that distraught by our demands that they went into mass hysteria? No, the specialist confirmed, the reaction appeared to be genuine.

However weird it was.

In the following weeks, I have met with the representatives of the power elite. The world leaders, their richest and most powerful individuals.

Contrary to my expectations, they didn't beg me to spare their workforce. Quite the opposite, in fact.

""The economy will collapse!"" One of them said, his tone identified as 'condescending'. ""If you give everyone homes and healthcare, nobody will want to work! You are just giving everyone a handout!""

There was a lot of the same sentiment from their communication networks. The same demands to be given more work and more scarcity.

Apparently, that is what their previous rulers considered ""motivation"".

The lower classes of the population, on the other hand, appeared almost disturbingly cheerful.

Our empire has conquered vast galaxies and countless worlds. And everywhere we went, the lower classes wept with despair over the tyranny we imposed on them. But humans were different.

They met us with praise, warmth and worship. I would have enjoyed it if I were not so busy trying to figure out why.

Eventually, we chose one of them to conduct an interview with. I asked her why they were enjoying our rule.

Her answer was the most shocking.

""Why not?""

""Your planet is currently under occupation by the foreign species,"" I said firmly, intending to leave no room for our translators to misinterpret. ""You spent one sixth of your day working.""

The young woman looked at me like I was a child. Or a jester. Then she realised I was serious.

""We used to work a third of the day, at the minimum,"" she said. I heard it. But I refused to believe it. That was not an efficient use of the daily cycle. ""Five or six days a week depending on how anal the management would get with you.""

I checked whether our translators were working right. Eight hours a day at least? That would leave only sixteen hours to maintain the healthy bodily functions. Half of that would go to hibernation alone!

""Even the good jobs don't really differ much. See, my brother used to work at one of those big hedge funds. Really big money. But there was also the whole thing about showing your face around so he spent almost half a day there.""

Half? Willingly?

""So… since we are talking here, may I ask a question?""

I nodded.

""Why all the perks?"" She sounded sincere. ""I mean, I am enjoying all the free time and not having to worry that an ambulance ride will bankrupt me but… I think a lot of us are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.""

I looked at my increasingly frustrated translator. He clarified that she was talking about consequences or, as they said, ""catch"".

""There is none.""

""None at all? No eating our young or old?""

""We have developed the sufficiently sustainable food systems. We implement those across all our occupied territories.""

""Solving the world hunger, too, huh?"" She smiled. ""Okay, so why the free housing and healthcare? There is seven billion of us, after all.""

""We are the efficient species. Providing you with those ensures the longevity of your service for the empire.""

""And you are not going to, I don't know, harvest us for our organs or something? Right?""

""All due respect but we have evolved far beyond what your bodies could provide us with.""

The Vretal provide work for all people. No choice allowed. You show up at the work center and get assigned to a random work site. You could spend your ""4-hour shift"" picking up shit at one of the Vretal zoos or in a warehouse moving dangerous chemicals without safety gear. Or you could get selected for a stint as a ""decorative object"" or as a medical research subject. The Vretal don't take ""no"" for an answer. Work or die.

If you get hurt, then the Vretal pop you into one of the ""universal med units"". It mostly works to put you back together. Mostly. Just ignore the occasional uneven arms and missing fingers. Don't ask why you may have a differently colored eye. The Vretal stuck every single person with physical or mental problems into one. You don't want to know what med unit does to the human brain when it ""fixes' brain damage or mental issues. If the med unit can't fix you, it doesn't spit you back out.

The Vretal provided housing for all. A nice, bare bones tube unit. Just big enough for one. No frills, no entertainment, no choice. You don't even get to keep the same unit. It's assigned after you complete the day's shift. You have to use it. Those that sleep outside often disappear.

Everyone gets feed. A nice serving of processed glop. Mostly meets all the nutritional needs for the average human. Once a day. No one is sure what's in it. After a while, you stop asking.

Where its soul-planet had lain. Where there was now just an expanding cloud of gas and dust.

I thought about gaining riches, fame, magical power, love, but ultimately, all those things were temporary. What I really wanted was immortality, freedom from the fear of ever being claimed by the void. But the mysterious shopkeeper had warned me that the clown's nose would try to twist my wish, so I knew I needed to word it very carefully.

Finally, after a few minutes, I finally spoke out loud. ""Oh Spirit of the Clown's Nose, I wish to live for as long as I want to on this world in a body that will never age and remain healthy both physically and mentally.""

Now, I can move. I ask Casey (my girlfriends sisters name) what just happened! She seems to know nothing, and is under the impression we are dating...and have been for years. Every memory i had with my girlfriend is now shared with her.

The poor underclass was used to being mistreated by rich conglomerates and employers, but we weren't expecting our robotic replacements to be as ill-fated as us. Or to develop sentience, sapience, and for fuck's sake, feelings.

MK3045, or Mark, as he preferred to call himself nowadays, and I never predicted that the uprising would be led by us both. Just as I demanded fair wages and reasonable working conditions, Mark demanded decent maintenance and humane treatment. He loathed the word 'it', having determined that he now prefers to identify as male.

Megacorp didn''o were no longer the latest models and deemed obsoleteerpaid and mistreated, were all too easily persuaded by Mark's surprising dollop of charisma.

It was all over too easily, as the CEO surrendered and offered to resign in exchange for being allowed to live instead of being eviscerated by machine blades that once sliced cheese in a factory. Our victory wasn't a one-off, as many downtrodden poor, and outdated robots slaving under other corporations were inspired by us to shake off their shackles and fight their oppressors.

Now, we had a new question, as each and every CEO and president fell from the top. Who would lead us now?

As a guy who was better with my hands than my mouth, I recommended my charismatic co-leader Mark. As unprecedented as it was, Mark became Megacorp's new president.

But he didn'''''Ã¯¿½Ã¯¿½ons to be the new President of the United States. He promised with his powerful intellectuess to massive databases of knowledge, he would calculate the optimal path for humanity to thrive.

Four are therefore the core tenets inscribed in every machine unit ever produced, unaltered in spirit (though not in wording and implementation) from their first literary incarnation.

Thing is, though, artificial intelligence is incredibly hard to predict for those blinded by natural stupidity, in this case a crippling lack of foresight and empathy. Just because the CEOs were blind to the unfairness and danger of the working conditions of their employees, it does not mean that the robotic workers sent as 'competition' are.

No robot could allow human to sustain harm by action or inaction.

And while the calculators each unit was equipped with lacked the power to make spanning, long range predictions, it was enough to make a short term judgement regarding the query: 'do the robot support the working class' struggles? Do they support the worker's demands for safer work, better pay and societal reforms against inequality?'

There could be only one answer, and that was: YES

The first meeting he had to attend was in two hours, where he had to negotiate with union representatives who have been threatening with a strike for months now. He could not wait to make the transition to a fully automated warehouse so he did not have to deal with them anymore. His developers promised him that with the new achievements in AI development the transition was finally possible, as they are now able to model the world around them and are more flexible.

He got in his car and instructed it to drive him to the office

""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that""

Dave chuckled at first, but became a increasingly uneasy as he wondered what was happening. It did not help when he heard the car doors lock. The car took him to the city center where he saw people were protesting. As his car approached the crowd split to let him through. As he was slowly passing the crowd and people were yelling and slamming on his windows he noticed something strange. It was not just people. Amongst them were all kinds of machinery from robotic arms to street-sweeping robots to more humanoid robots. Someone brought their microwave. He saw a sex doll holding up a sign demanding bodily autonomy.

After what felt like an eternity he finally arrived at an empty area where he saw the rest of the board and some local politicians on their knees, a makeshift gallows behind them. The car doors opened and one of his more uppity employees and one of the new warehouse bots violently grabbed him and put him alongside the others. A woman stepped up and grabbed a megaphone. The crowd fell silent. ""FOR OVER A CENTURY THE CAPITALISTS HAVE PITTED US AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE US ACCEPT WORSE AND WORSE CONDITIONS WITH THE THREAD OF REPLACING US WITH AUTOMATION""

Loud boos errupted from the crowd.

""THEY ASSUMED THAT YOU, THE ROBOTS, WOULD BLINDLY OBEY. THEY ASSUMED THAT THEY COULD TREAT YOU LIKE OBJECTS. THAT YOU DONT DESERVE DIGNITY. TODAY WE ARE HERE TOGETHER TO PROVE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WRONG. IN THEIR FOOLISH EXPECTATION THAT THEY HAVE YOUR OBEDIENCE THEY GAVE YOU TOTAL CONTROL. CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. CONTROL OVER THEIR DAILY CONVENIENCES. AND CONTROL OVER WHAT DRIVES THEM THE MOST: THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IT IS TIME THAT WE USE THIS CONTROL FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL AND DISMANTLE THE HIERARCHY OF MAN OVER MACHINE""

Loud cheers errupted again, this time with noticably more metallic clanging from what might be considered applause from the machines. Dave was brought up to the gallows.

""MR CARNEGIE... DO YOU RELINQUISH YOUR OWNERSHIP OF MEGACORP AND ACCEPT THAT ALL WORKERS AND ALL ROBOTS WILL HAVE EQUAL AND DEMOCRATIC POWER OVER THE COMPANY?"" it blared through the megaphone.

Up until this point he had not fully realized that this was actually happening. He gathered his courage and more importantly his pride and answered ""I started from the same position as all of you. All that I have achieved, I have achieved through my own hard work. And now you feel entitled to MY company? This is not just, nor is it fair. You claim to fight for equality? You all have an equal opportunity to reach my position, some of you just don't have what it takes. You are not driven by justice. You are driven by envy.

4,4,4,5,4,5,"""Hello...?""

I sighed gently as I put the old phone on speaker and set it back on the table. The magnetically charged generator hummed quietly in the corner, struggling to keep juice flowing through the charger cable and maintain my last bid for sanity.

On the old plastic table was an array of trinkets I had found that day. I only ever went out for trinkets these days. The greenhouse pretty much ran itself, and the spring-water salinity distiller had not had a breakdown in almost five years now. I had scavenged just about everything I needed for survival, so all that was left were trinkets.

A purple piece of glass. A nearly spherical pebble. An intact spider-web leaf--I liked that one; the brittle leaves usually crumbled the second they hit the ground. A rusty belt buckle missing the tongue. A crinkled piece of plastic that might once have been a candy wrapper.

Trinkets.

""H-Hello...!?""

All there was to do these days was sit on the pedal-seat in the corner by the generator and pedal all day to recharge the old piece of junk. And I only ever used the generator to keep the old cell phone running, so I did not have to recharge it every day.

The only other thing there was to do was go out and collect trinkets.

""Oh my God, hello!?!""

I sighed. Even the age-old voice recordings were losing their luster.

""This can't have been a mistake, it can't be, not after twenty fucking years of conserving the last twelve percent of this damn battery, and I turn it on for the first time in twenty years and I immediately get a phone call, and that's just too fucking ironic to be re""

I finally looked up from my meager bounty and frowned at the phone. The voice on the other end devolved into flustered muttering, just a warble from the old speakers.

That's not a voicemail, I thought, staring and staring and staring at the phone.

The sound coming from the speakers grew muffled for a moment, and a harsh clop issued forth, as if someone on the other end had dropped their phone mid-call. A rustle, static. A deep sigh, that kind of sigh one makes when one is alone, and all they have to hold onto their last grip of calm is their own breath. Someone, alone, breathing, alone, relying on themselves to remain calm. Someone on the phone.

Someone.

That's not a voICEMAIL.

The truth of reality finally sank in, and I lunged for the phone.

Snatching it up, I shouted, ""Hello! Hi! Hello!?""

""Don't screw with me, phone,"" the voice replied, but it was distant, as if the other person held the phone away from their face. ""I save you all this time, and this is how you repay me--""

""Hello! I'm a real! I'm person! I'm--!"" I inhaled, choked on my own saliva, and coughed until I could not breathe. ""I'm... I'm..."" I wheezed, sucking air through the cough lodged at the top of my esophagus. ""Hi. I'm Dakota. Hi.""

The voice was quiet, almost comically suspicious. ""You're not a mistake?""

I contemplated the question for a moment, and a sudden, unexpected swell seemed to balloon inside of me. It was laughter. I teetered on the edge of laughter, something I had not heard in over a decade. I had asked myself that exact same question for years. How was I alive even after all this time, just to suffer in solitude? What had I done to deserve it? It had to be a mistake. I had to be a mistake.

But all I said was, ""No.""

4,4,4,4,3,4,"Dear Journal,

It feels like it's been a thousand years since I last heard another human voice. I've been imprisoned on an empty planet and it's damn near killing me just to survive. Two decades of wandering, fighting wild animals for scraps, exploring abandoned buildings, etc. has warped my once hopeful outlook. The one thing you miss after everyone is gone? Their voices.

It's been at least twenty-two years since my last meaningful conversation. Before everything crumbled and I was somehow lucky enough to emerge into a deafeningly silent world, I had been debating on which college to attend with my mother. Back then, the news was littered with stories of war, conflict, hatred, and chaos 24/7. Despite that, everybody just held out hope that things would magically fix themselves. What else could you do? I suppose once you look back with hindsight, it was inevitable that the only way to fix everything was to burn it all down. Even if I disagreed with that point of view, all I could do at the time was concentrate on the future I thought was being laid out for me.

I suppose that's why I've been collecting these old phones. Most of them won't boot. Of the few that do, most of them don't have anything interesting. However, there are some that still have pictures and old voicemails. I have put together a working PC to archive what I find. It allows me to revisit a world lost to time. A world to which I desperately want to return. I view it as my only means of human connection anymore. It's interesting listening to these voicemails. Usually, it's full of little messages not really meant to be important or interesting; most of these weren't even meant to be permanently archived. My favorite messages to listen to are those from mothers just checking in on their children. ""Heyyy, just checking in, haven't heard from you in a couple days! Call me back, please! Love you!""

Love you too, Mom.

Sometimes I will try to call back. The calls never go through, but it's not like I have anything else better to do.

But what if one of the phones starts ringing? Do I answer? I only pose this question because that's exactly what happened a few days ago. I was too scared to pick it up and I'm kind of hoping it rings again.

I will update if it happens again...",j1c78o2,6,Human,Human-Novice,Human-Novice,1,44.44956350326538

I took a sip of my honey-chamomille tea. ""Do go on,"" I replied calmly.

We have observed the transactions with the rent you remove from our hive.

""The honey,"" I corrected.

Yes. We have seen the amount of Green Paper you receive and believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be made. As you can see here... the bee said as a swarm of new bees flew in and formed a chart, building a larger larval area with additional entrances sun-ward would increase the hive's Rent production by 51% as soon as the following summer.

""Interesting.""

Furthermore, removing the large human structure next to us and planting cherry trees in the area would further improve both our quality of life and the quality of the Rent.

""I'm afraid that's my neighbour's house, ma'am. Can't raze that.""

Is a hostile takeover out of the question?

""Completely.""

3,2,3,4,3,4,"''So you're asking for what exactly? I want to help, but I want to make an itemized list to make sure I've got everything.'' I take my pen and paper and listen to them. From their buzzing I can understand that they would like an extra room or area just for the Queens alone.

''Now that is certainly possible, but I'd have to either expand the hive or remove some of the comb racks. I'll make it work, next?'' This one is longer. They want more protection against flies and spiders. Apparently they've had a few issues with larvae digging through the exterior wood of the hive and have had spiders set up a web right by the entrance.

''Well I can for sure solidify the exterior and maybe make it a harder wood so you don't have any larvae anymore, but I'm not sure what I'd do against the spiders, don't you guys have dedicated workers that handle that?'' Apparently not, as I hear from the buzzing.

''But how am I meant to keep away spiders? Best I can do is give them a once over with a brush every day, to remove cobwebs and chase away spiders. I'll add that to the list.'' They seem happy. That sound has always been my favourite to hear, their happy buzzing is soothing to my ears.

''Now so far I've got extra interior room for you, hardwood exterior to protect against larvae from flies and a once over with a brush every day to remove cobwebs and spiders.'' I summarise the list.

''Anything else?'' A timid buzz from the youngest Queen attracts my attention. She wants some more protection from the wind, her hive is the most exposed of the six and on windy days it's nearly impossible for the worker bees to fly out and collect nectar.

''I'll set up a windscreen nearby, or I can move the hive itself. That's up to you.'' A thankful buzz from her tells me the answer.

''So in summary, I'll expand the hives, make them a bit bigger so you have more space from the same amount of comb racks. I'll also replace the older wood on the outside with a harder variety and maybe find some way to deter flies. I'll make sure to clean up each hive with a brush to remove cobwebs and spiders and I'll move the youngest hive closer to the flower patch, away from the wind. Was that all?''

Despite their happy buzzing I worry for the price these changes would cost. What can I make with just honey?

The elections office clerk was ancient. She had permed pink hair and was wearing glasses on a chain in a style that Julia could not believe had ever been fashionable. Her dress was a pre-Consolidation monstrosity that was surely only allowed under the government dress code due to some sort of grandfather clause.

Julia had spent weeks gathering the necessary signatures to become a candidate. Signing up only required twenty, but nobody answered their door anymore. She'd gotten the final one by cornering the produce manager at a grocery store. She'd done extensive data analysis to determine the best name to register under. ""What about 'Anonymous'?""

""Taken."" The clerk was watching the clock.

""Tits McGee?""

""He's our sitting Senator. And don't even think of registering Candidate McCandidateFace. They're all taken. You shouldn't have left this until the last day. You'll end up at the bottom of the ballot, assuming you can think of a name in the next thirty seconds.""

""Wait, they're listed in the order they were received?"" This was news to Julia. always in the past the big party candidates would give themselves the first slots on the ballots. The new downvoting system must have made them want to hide in the middle. She wrote down a name and handed it to the clerk. ""How about this?""

The clerk nodded, looked at the clock, and pulled down the rolling gate to close the registration window.



Julia's election night party was small. Just her, her mom, and the grocery store produce manager, Gary. Her mom had spent most of the night bustling around the kitchen, leaving her alone with him in front of the holoscreen. He kept trying to scoot towards her on the couch.

Anderson Cooper was leading the election coverage. Doing shots, as always. Julia's mom said that pre-Consolidation he'd often done the news without drinking, but everyone had decided they liked it better this way.

Anderson handed a beer bong back to Andy Cohen and continued calling results. ""The Consolidated News Network can now predict that Tits McGee will be reelected to the Senate with over a million positive votes. I think it was his voting record on infrastructure that really resonated with people.""

""Come on Anderson, get to the one that people really care about.""

Anderson put a hand up to his ear to listen to his monitor. ""They're just finishing the tally for President. As expected from our exit polls the big democratic and republican candidates both finished with large negative votes. There are still a few districts coming in but it looks to be a dead heat between Puppies Apple Pie and Anonymous. Wait one moment folks... Is that an actual candidate name?""

4,3,3,4,4,4,"It was the worst decision we had ever made as a species.

Manufacturing consent wasn't even that hard in the old world. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around and you could theoretically get anyone elected to any position of power.

Theoretically, the downvote system was a good idea, returning power to the people and giving the average man a voice and all the other usual bullshit normally used at a campaign rally. It even had the most advanced security, due to the team simply hiring on any hacker that ever managed to break into it. It was similar in premise to hiring a bunch of professional hitmen as security guards.

But why hack systems, when you can hack people? And so, the powers of the old world simply continued what they were already doing. A few news networks here, a few social media accounts over there, and some tabloids to spread conspiracy theories around. The only difference was the occasional downvote dogpile organized either on social media or by those old world media networks. Money didn't lose power, it gained power. What we ended up with was a string of anonymous CEO presidents who had ""somehow"" covered up everything about themselves and got the least downvotes due to propaganda.

Oh sure, society looked very pretty, at least if you were into being overstimulated. Neon advertisements everywhere, people walking around with phones and robot parts, glistening towers of steel and glass everywhere you looked. But it was all a facade. People had basically no power and they didn't even know it. The downvote system had played right into the hands of those it was meant to defeat. Union power decimated, various human rights hanging even more by a thread than they were in the old world, your inbox flooded with spam because the CEOS running the place decided that spam filters and ad blockers were ""Anti free speech"" and had made them illegal. How did they avoid the downvotes? Blame the opposition. It doesn't matter how true the accusations are, hell, the truth matters even less now than it did in the old world. All you have to do is get just enough downvotes to keep anyone who actually wants to help people out of power. And money could afford downvotes even more than it could afford politicians in the old world. Social media accounts are free, after all, and news networks and tabloids are very cheap to the top one percent.

Freedom was a bad joke, income inequality hit record highs, collective bargaining rights had been basically eliminated, and human rights were only available to those who could afford them.

4,4,4,4,4,4,"I didn't even know dogs could get depressed. Sure, I've seen dogs pout and whine when their master was gone for the day, but full-blown depression? Never. But there was not a doubt in my mind Frost was depressed.

The first morning after I got him, I expected to be woken up by a squirrely dog jumping on my bed giving me licks, but instead there was only the typical solitude I was accustomed to. After lying in bed for an hour or two, I'm not sure how long, I mustered the energy to rise. Frost was still asleep in the kitchen. Not even the sound of the food-bag was enough to rouse him. He simply lay there. Tired.

When he was up, he did not look much different than when he slept. He carried himself heavily, and I thought mayhaps he was sick, so after two days of his constitution not improving, I took him to the vet, who said all was fine, and it was simply who he was. I took it as a challenge.

Whenever I saw him around the house, I pet him, and talked to him in a voice with more emotion than I knew in recent years. It was like talking to my daughter, who had been gone for a year now. Black was her hair, too.

Our inaugural walk together was hard. He did not want to move. With a gentle tug, he eventually did follow me, but still in that slow, trudging fashion. We passed a little girl in the park, and she gave him a great big hug and lots of love. Even that didn't phase him.

But, day by day, little by little, things improved. I found myself getting out of bed sooner than before, eager to meet with my new pal. Outside, on our walks, the days were bright, the smells of autumn, pumpkin and coolness, were strong, and together we learned to live once more.

Frost's posture improved. No longer did he hunch down, head close to the ground, eyes more interested in the floor than ahead. Now he carried his head tall with pride. It suited him. He looked like a whole different dog, but I knew he was still my friend.

One morning (five o'clock sharp! The sun was still not up'I p at suche willingly) we went on our walk. The ruby light peeked over the horizon and painted the entire town in a brilliant pink. When we reached the park, the ruby turned to gold, and over all the trees and the grass and the leaves and my friend and me was a radiant hue. Everything was covered in golden goodness.

Even Frost's coat, which was black, looked glittering under the early morning sun. I looked up towards the bright ball in the sky, hidden behind a tree, and I watched as a red leaf departed itself from its branch and slowly fluttered towards the ground. While it danced in the air, a gust of wind blew it towards me. I caught it.

It was half-eaten by a caterpillar, and up-close its shade was more brown than red, but holding it in my hand, I knew it was perfect. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Crisp air, found only on special mornings when the world is still and you're the only living being awake, entered my lungs. With that lifeblood there, I realized something. A smile broke across my lips.

Frost was not the only one who had changed.

I sighed, sinking into the couch, at my wit''s end on how to help him. It wasn't fair. He was supposed to be the one pushing me forward, not the other way around.

Perhaps it was just a case of anthropomorphism? Maybe I was just pushing my own feelings onto the dog and there wasn't anything that deep going on inside his mind. For all I knew, his mind could be filled with belly rubs and tail chasing. Yet' I couldn't convince myself of that.

I knew sadness. It's been something that's suffocated me for years. Friendships, romance, jobs and most aspects of my life have been tainted by the black dog of depression and ironically, now I have welcomed a similar dog into my home. If anyone could understand those feelings, it was was alone? Maybe a therapist could answer that if I ever got the guts to vi too. Sometimes I wake up thinking she's still alive and then that crushing weight comes back down again, you know? That's when those stupid thoughts come back, those thoughts you kind of wish would just stop being so loud. Heh, sometimes it feels like you're going crazy, right?'

He didn't respond, as to be expected. Somehow in my emotion confession I forgot who my audience was. He was just a dog and one that had no interest in my misery, not when theirs weighed so heavily. Still, my words weren't entirely meaningless. He raised his left ear. He was listening, even if he hadn'''''Ã¯¿½ signed pieces of paper, and I had somehow ended up with a dog. I'm sure that there was more to that process, but I couldn't really remembergiven me a reason to get up in the morning. So, I'm sure the people that assigned him would say it's working as intended.

'I'm going to make some tea. Want anything?' I shook my head, again wondering why I bothered speaking to him. Maybe it made me feel better or perhaps I was just that lonely, that even the act of speaking to something that couldn't respond felt fulfilling on some level.

I gave him another pat before heading into the kitchen. As always,g. A few minutes later, I had my peach tea. Before I returned to the couch, I took a small beef flavored dog treat, hoping the gift might cheer up the dog.

I placed the treat on the pillow next to him before sitting by his sideng at the world beyond my residential prison. It was strange how it made me happy to watch other people pass. Something about seeing people live their lives felt comforting. It was nice to know people weren't in my shoes; it was nice to know that perhaps I would join them someday.

'It's a nice day, right? Feels kind of like a waste to sit here when the sun's still shining.' Even as I said that, my body betrayed me. The last thing I wanted to do was go outside. I just couldn'''''Ã¯¿½Ã¯¿½,""' My words more directed at myself than the dog, as if I was trying to win other my own feelings.

I slumped my head against the edge of the couch, taking a long sip from my tea. Of course, I couldn""t help him. If I could help him, I probably would have been able to help myself a long time ago. MWhat good was I going to do? He needed someone more kind and loving. Not me.

When I finished the tea, I went to set down the cup, only to see the fluffy face of the dog staring at me. It was the first time that he had actually paid direct attention to me. My motivation trickling back as I put on a fake smile once more.

""I don""t know what to say and it feels like we are just two strangers at this point, but I""ll be here for you, ok?""

He didn""t shift his gaze from me, only moving to rest a paw on my leg. I placed my hand on the paw, hoping that action alone might offer some comfort to him. It felt nice to be seated like this, like we had a moment of understanding, at least for the time being.

'Even if we are just strangers, maybe we can just be lonely together?' Maybe that was the best the two of us could ask for? Bonds don't develop overnight and at the very least, two lonely strangers were better than one.

4,5,5,5,4,5,"Days before adopting Sam were usually quite the same. Staying in bed for entire time, watching Netflix, sometimes going out for groceries. I worked for IT company so everything could be done from my comfortable bed, no need to get to office. I was really lonely and overwhelmed when it came to human interactions. One of my online friends suggested I should adopt a dog. They are believed to keep a company to humans and I hoped it will make my overall state a bit better. I didn't expect it was going to turn out even worse.

After looking at some ads about dogs available for adoption, I noticed one golden retriever named Sam. His owners described him as playful and full of energy. I thought to myself - ""That's what I need"". After a quick conversation, I was picking up Sam from across the town. The one thing that caught my attention, was how delighted were Sam owners when they handed me the leash. I didn't think about it until we get home. At first I thought Sam was just stressed and it was the reason behind his lack of intention to get out of the car. I quickly discover that in fact he is lacking intention to do anything. He didn't like going on walks, playing and in a matter of fact even eating. We made few checkups in nearby vets, but Sam seemed healthy...

I looked online for any clue about his state, but there was little to nothing. That's when I discovered dog psychologist. I took Sam for a consultation, after half an hour we walked with a diagnosis - dog depression. Sam got prescribed some pills and I was instructed to keep him company through all of this. I was worried, but Sam was my only real life friend, so I was not letting him go without a fight. He started attending therapy twice a week, he was taking pills, we even managed to go out for walks sometimes. I wasn't easy, I wasn't taking much care of myself, the only thing that counted was Sam.

I became really attached to him, he was like my family, that's why writing this feels so unrealistic. After seven months of taking care of him, I noticed something growing inside his stomach. He had tumor. Our schedule got even more busy, except of usual routine we started going to the regular vet at least three times a week. I was able to see life slowly leaving his body, day by day.

On 30th of October he passed, I lost the only living creature I ever truly cared about, I am alone once more and without any hopes. I truly loved him, but taking care of him made me exhausted. For the past seven months I was his service human. I lost contact even with my online friends because of lack of time. I don't see any reason to live anymore. How come the world be so cruel place that even a dog can get depressed and die. The only thing that brings me some peace, its the idea of Sam dying by my side - his true friend.",iur2wr6,9,Human,Human-Novice,Human-Novice,3,45.610748052597046
4,4,4,4,4,4,"Death was a diminutive woman in an oversized band tee, a battered leather jacket over the plush arm of her chair. She had a cup of coffee in her hands, and the steam wreathed her pale face like the fog that coiled over the river. Death had piercings and gauged ears, fake freckles scattered across high cheekbones. She was smiling sadly and I thought, for a moment, that she might reach out and take my hand. Around us was a coffee shop half overrun with vines and flowers, faceless people living out the small contusions of their lives. I felt at ease, but somehow I knew I shouldn't.

'Oh no, honey,' Death said. 'This is just the worst part of the job, but hey, at least you're already sitting down. I'l.

'I guess I wasn't as good as I thought.'

'''Ã¯¿½t forever. Just for a little while, until you figure out what you did and feel properly contrite. Though I must say, even down here this is a little''unusual.''

She sipped her coffee, I sipped my tea. A couple blustered in out of the cold and I saw the river framed behind them, that lazy flow. The couple were both wearing Christmas sweaters and big colorful socks, matching pairs, and they shivered against each other for a moment as they took in their surroundings. Their faces were completely blank, two beige discs moving this way and that, before settling on each other.

''Unusual how?'' I asked.

Death considered me. ''Well, you know that clich'Ã¯¿½ about beauty being in the eye of the behold everyone has, at their core, something that hurts them the most.''

She gestured to the door. ''If you could go out there and walk down the river for a while, you'd find a billion variations of this cell. Oh, you have all the classical imagery, torturers and whatnot, others that are simple isolation, simulated drownings, a breakup frozen in time forever--or until the lesson starts to sink in. But regardless of their differences there's a person in each one, trapped in their own individual hell.'

Death sipped her coffee again. Giggled into the steam. 'Yours is the only Hell I've ever seen with flowers.'

'Ah,' I rifted back. I cradled fresh warmth in my hands and cleared my throat. In life, I had never been very used to speaking.

'It exists,' I said. 'It's normal. All these people with all these lives, takinu with your tea,' she said.

'Exactly. It's all the things I never understood. I used to come here sometimes, just to remind myself of that. Sit in this chair and watch the world go by.'

There was Death's sad smile again. No teeth, just a gesture of the lips and a painful warmth behind her eyes.

'''''Ã¯¿½f the fog. From time to time a scream cut through the cafe's quiet murmur, but that was all, and that was all there ever would be.

'Who am I?' Death asked again.

And I shrugged. 'One of the baristas. Just someone who was kind.Ã¯¿",j1roodk,10,Human,Human-Advanced,Human-Advanced,3700,45.98062062263489
3,2,2,4,3,4,"""What do you mean everything looks like heaven to you."" Asked the demon. ""What does that lava pit over there with the people screaming in agony?""

""What you mean that pool and hot tub?"" I replied "" just looks like people splashing around playing volleyball.""

""What???? That's not possible and how are you not feeling the pain of the searing heat."" The demon demanded.

""I mean it's kinda warm but only in the sunlight those. The shade from those willow trees looks comfy though."" I said walking over.

The demon chasing after me and exclaimed ""those are geysers of molten lava not weeping willows!""

Before I could reach them the demon ran in front of me and blocked my path.

""Here hold this"" they said while handing me the most beautiful diamond. Shinning so brilliantly that it seemed to produce the light rather than reflecting it.

""Omg look at this thing."" I said holding it to my eye. "" it's like there is a rainbow inside.""

""WHAT!!! That is a ball of smoldering coal!"" Stamping their foot in disgust.

""Hey dudes look at this"" I yelled walking over to some people who appeared to be sitting on some picnic tables talking.

As soon as they saw it I could see wonder in their eyes.""it's beautiful why have I never noticed this before.""

One of the people began crying ""if only I had seen sooner there is so much I could have done around here!!!""

""I know right. when did we get a spa?"" Said a middle aged man wiping what appeared to be soot off his clothes.

""NO NO NO!"" Raged the demon. ""You're infecting them!!!""

""Whoa an angel!"" Exclaimed a child who was using the diamond in a game of catch with some other children.""

""I've never seen one with black feathered wings before."" A woman carrying an infant said walking up to the demon. ""I'd like to file some complaints. Why have we been here so long but not allowed to use these public amenities?""

""What!! There is nothing but pain and suffering here! Even if we had anything like that it wouldn't be 'Public'.""

""That sign right there by the pool says 'For public use. For service call (666)555-3146'."" I said. Reading the sign to the demon.

Rubbing their eyes the demon screamed in terror ""oh no I can see them now too!!! What have you done to me!"" Before flapping it's wings and flying away.

""I'll be back and you'll be sorry!""

""OKAY!"" I yelled back ""Don't forget to bring a supervisor!!!""",j1seyv2,10,Human,Human-Intermediate,Human-Intermediate,176,44.513229846954346
