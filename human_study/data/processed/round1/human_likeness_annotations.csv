3,0,5,"The story exhibits a level of creativity, emotional depth, and nuanced storytelling that suggests it was likely written by a human rather than a language model.",,Vicuna-33B,LLM
4,0,1,"The story seems overly simplistic, trying to capture a happy ending without providing any real internal tension or conflict.",,Vicuna-33B,LLM
6,0,1,"It just feels like this is how a LLM would interpret human emotional complexity -- it's fine, but not captivating or authentic feeling. Giving the characters full names (is it picky to also say that the names felt uninspired?) for no discernible reason also strikes me as something that a human author wouldn't do but a LLM would.",,Vicuna-33B,LLM
7,0,1,"I feel like the prompt wasn't answered. The demon told them that they were in heaven, but the prompt asked the writer to make a story about them discovering that they were in hell. The names are also very basic as well.",,Vicuna-33B,LLM
3,1,4,"The story exhibits a level of creativity, emotional depth, and narrative complexity that suggests it was likely written by a human.",,Llama-2-70B,LLM
6,1,1,"The use of full names for no narratively significant reason makes me feel like this was created by a LLM, but also this story is just quite bland and not interesting.","This story in particular provoked boredom in me, which is a feeling I seldom actively notice happening while reading!",Llama-2-70B,LLM
7,1,2,"Both the names are basic again and both start with J, which is interesting to me. The ending is also very happy and not much conflict happens throughout the story.",,Llama-2-70B,LLM
3,2,4,"The story exhibits a high degree of creativity, humor, and a nuanced understanding of human desires, suggesting it was likely written by a human rather than a language model.",,GPT-4,LLM
6,2,4,"This one is difficult to determine because the language is so complex, and there are a lot of (usually incorrectly used) semi-colons, which is an error I see human authors make, so I'm more inclined to think this was written by a human. However, the final paragraph sounds very much like an LLM summarization, which is tripping me up.","This was a pretty fun story! If this was written by a human who asked me for editing advice, I would recommend for them to simplify their language and remove the final paragraph.",GPT-4,LLM
7,2,5,I do not think that AI would create the hashtag in the middle of the story. I also think that the descriptions of the clown nose and town at the beginning of the story are telling of human-like writing.,,GPT-4,LLM
3,3,3,"The story exhibits creative and imaginative elements, suggesting a human author.",,Llama-2-7B,LLM
6,3,2,The repetition of the exact words used in the prompt make me inclined to think this was written by an LLM.,"The first paragraph has a distinctive type of syntax/writing style that it implements, but it drops off pretty much as quickly as it starts, and the rest of the story very much tells the narrative rather than shows it. In general, the later part of the story feels much blander than the beginning part.",Llama-2-7B,LLM
7,3,1,The format of the short story is very atypical. The story overall is also very basic in its sentence structure.,,Llama-2-7B,LLM
3,4,3,"The story exhibits creative and imaginative elements, suggesting a human author.",,Llama-2-13B,LLM
6,4,2,"I have seen TV shows where this sort of writing was implemented, so purely based on that, I could believe if this was written by a real person, but I'm going to guess that this was written by an LLM. But I know human writers are capable of so so so much more.","This story wasn't very interesting. The repeated use of words like ""silly"" and ""goofy"" was distracting and felt like it was forcibly inserted because the prompt had the word ""clown"" in it.",Llama-2-13B,LLM
7,4,2,"Likely AI. There are elements that indicate human writing like the questions asked, but the writing overall is very basic and lacks style.",,Llama-2-13B,LLM
3,5,5,"The story exhibits a high level of creativity, emotional depth, and nuanced exploration of philosophical concepts, suggesting it was likely written by a human.",,GPT-4,LLM
4,5,5,"The advanced vocabulary and use of literary techniques such as alliteration, anaphora, metaphors not only make the story more interesting but show a level of complexity that I feel makes the story more likely to be written by a human.",,GPT-4,LLM
6,5,5,"The explanation of how feeling unfulfillment and longing is what haunts you throughout your experience in Hell feels like something only a human would understand--these are probably among the most detested and feared human emotions and experiences, and I think only a human would know that this is a good thing to write about.",I liked this story a lot!!! I really hope a real person wrote this because I think they are a great writer!!! Very compelling and well done. I enjoyed the diction and dialogue very much.,GPT-4,LLM
7,5,5,The first paragraph indicated to me that this was written by a human as it was complex and very descriptive. I don't think that these kinds of descriptions could be generated by AI.,,GPT-4,LLM

6,6,3,"The stuff about Commander Rythor and the aliens feels so much more real, while the content about the humans feels far more uninteresting to me. I'm stumped on whether or not this is human authored.",John's character really feels like it floats through the story without actually affecting things; I would've liked for him to feel like he has more of an impact. The final line is really cheesy.,Llama-2-7B,LLM
7,6,1,"The name John Smith is incredibly basic, and so is the writing style overall. There is not much description of the scene, it is mostly just plot. The commander of the aliens is also introduced with little to no warning.",,Llama-2-7B,LLM
3,7,2,I'm convinced this is LLM authorship due to the simplicity of the story and grammatical errors throughout the entirety of it with the addition of no direction or conclusion to this story.,,Vicuna-33B,LLM
6,7,2,"There's so little content here that I can't really make a definitive judgement one way or the other, but I'm leaning towards LLM authorship solely because of the technological smart hive references.",Needs more!,Vicuna-33B,LLM

3,8,4,"The story exhibits a level of creativity, emotional depth, and nuanced character portrayal that suggests a higher likelihood of being written by a human.",,GPT-4,LLM
6,8,4,"Something about how the words are strung together feels human to me, and the way the prose creates space between the dialogue also feels quite human to me, but maybe AI storytelling is just way better than I thought possible.

7,9,1,The writing does not answer from the parent's point of view like the prompt asked. The writing style is also very basic and the story is mostly background and not fleshed out.,,Llama-2-7B,LLM
3,10,5,The comedial and informal structure of this story makes it almost certain this was written by a human.,,Human-Novice,Human
4,10,4,"I think it was probably written by a human because of the use of Gen Z lingo and there was a typo where the word ""at"" was repeated twice.",,Human-Novice,Human
6,10,5,"I've read a lot of stories from people on r/writingprompts, and there's a certain genre of stories that falls into this kind of category; it's marked by aggressive language, a flash fiction kind of length, and usually opens with a sentence that essentially communicates ""Stop f***ing around.""",,Human-Novice,Human
7,10,4,"I think the cursing is characteristic of humans, so I think a human would write this.",,Human-Novice,Human
3,11,3,The presence of emotional nuances and the nuanced exploration of cosmic consequences leans slightly toward human-like narrative construction.,,Llama-2-70B,LLM
6,11,1,"Repeated use of rhetorical questions--this is something that is often used in example short stories that are included in online writing resources, but I find that experienced human writers rarely actually utilize them. And, if they do, it's never as much as seen in this story.",,Llama-2-70B,LLM

6,12,1,"Lack of psychological/emotion depth, and the rhetorical questions.",,Llama-2-70B,LLM
7,12,1,"From the very beginning, when the story was told from a third-person perspective, I thought that it might have been written by AI. It does not answer the prompt and put the reader in a first person perspective.",,Llama-2-70B,LLM
3,13,4,The story demonstrates a level of creativity and emotional intelligence that aligns with human-authored narratives.,,Vicuna-33B,LLM
7,13,1,"With the conclusion, I don't think a person would try to create or form a message out of a short story for the reader to ""learn from.""",,Vicuna-33B,LLM
3,14,4,The story demonstrates a nuanced understanding of human emotions and experiences in the face of the unknown.,,Vicuna-33B,LLM
6,14,1,"Unnecessary repetition, weird and unnatural reflection on the resilience of humanity. I don't think a human writer would do this, especially not one that has such a strong command of language that creates such rich, ornate details and descriptions as is seen in this story.",This story is way too long for what it's actually describing.,Vicuna-33B,LLM
7,14,1,The cliche descriptions at the beginning of the piece indicated to me that this was AI writing.,,Vicuna-33B,LLM
3,15,4,The story exhibits a level of creativity and emotional depth that aligns with human-authored narratives.,,Vicuna-33B,LLM
6,15,1,"Rhetorical questions, repeating exact words used in the prompt, description of events rather than showing us through narrative.","Reading a story that opens with ""Once upon a time in a distant universe"" is a little painful!",Vicuna-33B,LLM

6,16,1,The topics covered feel very much like something an LLM would write about.,,Llama-2-13B,LLM
7,16,1,"Once I saw the name Jameson Smith, I had a feeling this was AI written. There seems to be a pattern with texts that I believe to be AI and the introduction of a character by their first and last name. I also think the mention of AI in this story is quite unusual, and I don't know if a person's first thought would be to go for that idea.",,Llama-2-13B,LLM
3,17,3,The story demonstrates a level of emotional nuance and exploration of complex themes that aligns with human-authored narratives.,,Llama-2-70B,LLM
7,17,1,"I had a feeling from the beginning that this was AI generated. The elements of the story are very basic, and it answers the prompt in the way that you would expect this prompt to be answered; there's no imagination.

3,18,5,The story demonstrates a level of emotional depth and creativity in portraying the lives of bees with a human-like connection. The anthropomorphism and the nuanced interactions make it more likely to be human-generated.,,Llama-2-7B,LLM
7,18,4,"I think the differences in speech (such as ""ye"") indicate that a human most likely wrote this. But, it does have the AI characteristic of a blatant lesson at the end of the story of the generations learning to work together.",,Llama-2-7B,LLM

4,20,4,The story demonstrates a level of emotional depth and creativity in exploring the vampire's relationship with video games.,,Llama-2-13B,LLM
7,20,1,"The writing style is very consistent throughout--too consistent almost. Marcus is also not a name that strikes fear, so I wouldn't use it for a Vampire.",,Llama-2-13B,LLM
4,21,2,"While it exhibits qualities associated with human writing, there are some issues associated with the conclusion mainly due to the way it cuts short without any punctuation.",,Vicuna-33B,LLM

6,28,3,A part of me thinks it is written by a human by I am skeptical of the fact that there are no names offered and the use of â€œmy partnerâ€ makes the legitimacy of the relationship and â€œbetrayalâ€ seem fake.,,Llama-2-13B,LLM
