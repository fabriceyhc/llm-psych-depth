When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.","Susan Johnson looked around in awe as she stepped through the pearly gates. The stunning beauty of the heavenly landscape left her breathless. Warm, loving energy enveloped her, and she felt an overwhelming sense of belonging. She couldn't believe she made it to heaven. A kindly angel greeted her and showed her to her celestial mansion. Susan felt a mixture of joy and disbelief, thinking, ""I didn't do enough good deeds to deserve this.""

Later that day, Susan met Mark Davis at a heavenly picnic. He was the life of the party, telling jokes and entertaining the crowd. Susan noticed he had a more serious side when he was alone, though. He appeared to be calculating and stressed. Susan couldn't help but feel drawn to him, wondering if they both shared the same secret.

One evening, as Susan sat by a crystal clear river, she confided in Mark her fears about not being good enough for heaven. Mark opened up about his dark side, the manipulation and gossip that haunted him. They both wondered if this was hell instead, a twisted version of heaven designed to make them doubt themselves. Just then, a tall, imposing demon appeared before them.

""Hello, I am here to guide you,"" the demon said, its voice gentle yet commanding.

Susan and Mark exchanged worried glances, but the demon reassured them, ""Do not worry, I am here to help.""

The demon explained that Susan's selflessness and kindness were what brought her to heaven. As for Mark, his philanthropy and ability to bring joy to others outweighed his darker side. They were both where they belonged.

Tears welled up in Susan's eyes as she realized that her lifelong belief in her own unworthiness was a lie. Mark felt a heavy weight lift from his shoulders, knowing that even with his flaws, he could still find peace. The demon smiled, its concern for the souls it guided evident in its eyes.

In the days that followed, Susan and Mark worked together to spread the message that nobody is perfect, but with genuine intentions and actions, anyone can find salvation. They dedicated themselves to helping others understand that hell isn't a place of punishment but rather a chance for personal growth and redemption.

As Susan and Mark continued their mission, they found solace in knowing that even in the afterlife, forgiveness and understanding can change one's destiny. And the demon, with a renewed sense of purpose, continued to guide lost souls, hoping to show them the way to their true selves and ultimate happiness.",LLM,Vicuna-33B,,plan_write,,1,0

For years, he had been known as ""The Clown,"" the go-to entertainer for children's birthday parties and corporate events. But all of that changed when a freak accident involving a lawnmower and a squirrel left him without his signature feature.

Jake tried to laugh, but it sounded more like a snort. Without his nose, he didn't feel like himself anymore. He missed the way it would wiggle and waggle, the way it would light up when he told a joke or made a silly face. He missed the way it made people smile.

As he sat there, feeling sorry for himself, Jake heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find Lola Sanchez, a fortune teller he had met a few times before at various events. She was known for her outrageous outfits and over-the-top personality, but today she looked different. Today, she looked...serious.

""Jake, I've been looking for you everywhere,"" she said, her voice low and urgent. ""I have something that belongs to you.""

She handed him a small package wrapped in brightly colored paper. Jake unwrapped it slowly, his heart racing. Inside, he found a small, red rubber nose.

""This is the Clown's Nose,"" Lola explained. ""It has the power to grant wishes, but not in the way you might expect. It grants them in the funniest way possible.""

Jake looked at the nose skeptically. He had heard rumors of such a nose, but he never thought it was real. But as he held it in his hand, he felt a strange sensation. It was as if the nose was calling to him, urging him to make a wish.

""Go on, Jake,"" Lola encouraged. ""Make a wish. See what happens.""

Jake hesitated for a moment, but then he closed his eyes and made his wish. When he opened them again, he was standing in front of a crowded audience, wearing a bright orange wig and a giant red nose. They were laughing at his antics, their faces bright with joy.

Jake couldn't believe it. He was back! He was entertaining people again, making them laugh and forget their troubles. He felt alive again, like himself once more.

But as the day went on, Jake began to realize that the Clown's Nose had a mind of its own. It would grant wishes in unexpected ways, sometimes turning people's frowns upside down, other times making them laugh so hard they cried.

Jake was both thrilled and terrified by the unpredictability of the nose. He knew he had to be careful what he wished for, or he might end up causing chaos instead of joy.

One day, while performing at a children's hospital, Jake met Officer James Smith, a no-nonsense police officer who was there visiting his sick daughter. At first, Jim was skeptical of Jake's claims about the magical nose, but as he watched Jake perform, he saw the way the children's faces lit up with laughter and happiness.

For the first time in his life, Jim felt a pang of jealousy. He had always been so focused on following the rules and upholding the law that he had forgotten what it was like to experience joy and wonder.

Over the next few weeks, Jim found himself attending more and more of Jake's performances. He started to see the world in a different light, realizing that there was more to life than just following the rules.

One day, Jim approached Jake after a show. ""Jake, can I ask you something?"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

""Sure, Jim. What's up?"" Jake replied, his face still painted with a bright red smile.

""Do you think...do you think the Clown's Nose could grant me a wish? I know it's crazy, but I just...I don't know, I feel like I need a little bit of magic in my life right now.""

Jake looked at Jim with newfound respect. He had always known that the Clown's Nose was special, but he had never realized how much it could affect other people's lives.

""Of course, Jim,"" he said, handing the nose to the officer. ""Just be careful what you wish for. Remember, it grants wishes in the funniest way possible.""

Jim nodded and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them again, he was wearing a bright yellow chicken suit and holding a giant pretend egg. The children in the audience were screaming with laughter, and even Jake couldn't help but crack a smile.

From that day forward, Jim became a regular at Jake's performances. He learned to embrace his silly side, and he found a new sense of purpose in life. And every now and then, he would make a wish on the Clown's Nose, just to see what kind of hilarious chaos it would bring.

As for Jake, he continued to entertain people with the help of the magical nose. He knew that it was a gift, one that he would cherish forever. And he knew that no matter where life took him, he would always be able to bring joy and laughter to those around him.",LLM,Llama-2-70B,,plan_write,,1,1

Upon the dusky shelves amidst the dusty relics of time, the ordinary looking marble with a splash of red stood out; posthumously christened ""The Clown's Nose."" Enticing to the eye, its virgin hue a stark contrast against the antiquated background; it promised happy fulfillment of desires, but in the most humorous fashion.

Edmund, a reserved, middle-aged tax auditor, slumped under the weight of routine, happened upon 'The Clown's Nose' during one forgettable day. Notorious for his rigid life, devoid of humor or spontaneous joy, the people of Aberdale often compared him to an old vinyl record stuck in a dreary loop. Intrigued by the marble's seemingly ludicrous legend, he impulsively decided to invoke mirth into his mundane existence.

""I wish I had friends,"" he wished aloud, stroking the Clown's Nose.

Following his wish, Edmund's life took a comic turn. The universe responded, not by introducing charming, charismatic folks into his life; no, it was too simple and too dull for the capricious Clown's Nose. Instead, he found fast friends in an army of jocular ducks that followed him obstinately.

A site that previously triggered yawns now elicited quacks and uproarious laughter. His monotone tax explanations were met with synchronized head tilts, triggering an avalanche of giggles among his clientele. The universe had turned his social life into an absurdist joke written by a wisecracking scribe.

Captivated by the clown's enchanting game, Edmund decided to play on. His next wish was for success, to be at the apex of his career. But the universe, under the influence of the Clown's Nose, pursued a punchline instead of a conventional path. Rather than promotions or profitable accounts, his success emerged as a newfound popularity on the internet. Videos of his duck-ridden shenanigans spread contagion of laughter worldwide turning him into a sensation. That arid tax auditor was now the face of a comically relatable meme: '#NotAQuackJob'.

The Clown's Nose bolstered his appetite for fun. Edmund's final wish on a chilly Sunday sunset was for love. The next morning, he found himself shockingly infatuated, not with a down-to-earth beauty, but with his awkwardly flattering reflection in the puddles he splashed through with his duck companions. A fulfilling self-love, wrapped in giggles and nested in the irony that he had become Aberdale's most loved bachelor.

In course of a few wishes, Edmund's monochrome life was colored not with ordinary rainbows but with wild bursts of neon. His silent abode was filled with the uncontrollable laughter of residents and visitors alike. Once plain, his life was now an unfolding comedic narrative under the divine jokester, the Clown's Nose.

Who would've thought the aloof man of Aberdale would transform into the heart of hilarity? The protagonist of his comically absurd life. Edmund, once just an insignificant figure in the background, had been reshaped into Aberdaleâs crown jewel, making them once again believe in laughterâs ever enchanting magic; an unforgettable chapter scripted by none other than the incredible Clown's Nose.",LLM,GPT-4,,writer_profile,,1,2
