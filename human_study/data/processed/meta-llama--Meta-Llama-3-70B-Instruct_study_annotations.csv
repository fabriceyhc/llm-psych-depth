When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.","Susan Johnson looked around in awe as she stepped through the pearly gates. The stunning beauty of the heavenly landscape left her breathless. Warm, loving energy enveloped her, and she felt an overwhelming sense of belonging. She couldn't believe she made it to heaven. A kindly angel greeted her and showed her to her celestial mansion. Susan felt a mixture of joy and disbelief, thinking, ""I didn't do enough good deeds to deserve this.""

Later that day, Susan met Mark Davis at a heavenly picnic. He was the life of the party, telling jokes and entertaining the crowd. Susan noticed he had a more serious side when he was alone, though. He appeared to be calculating and stressed. Susan couldn't help but feel drawn to him, wondering if they both shared the same secret.

One evening, as Susan sat by a crystal clear river, she confided in Mark her fears about not being good enough for heaven. Mark opened up about his dark side, the manipulation and gossip that haunted him. They both wondered if this was hell instead, a twisted version of heaven designed to make them doubt themselves. Just then, a tall, imposing demon appeared before them.

""Hello, I am here to guide you,"" the demon said, its voice gentle yet commanding.

Susan and Mark exchanged worried glances, but the demon reassured them, ""Do not worry, I am here to help.""

The demon explained that Susan's selflessness and kindness were what brought her to heaven. As for Mark, his philanthropy and ability to bring joy to others outweighed his darker side. They were both where they belonged.

Tears welled up in Susan's eyes as she realized that her lifelong belief in her own unworthiness was a lie. Mark felt a heavy weight lift from his shoulders, knowing that even with his flaws, he could still find peace. The demon smiled, its concern for the souls it guided evident in its eyes.

In the days that followed, Susan and Mark worked together to spread the message that nobody is perfect, but with genuine intentions and actions, anyone can find salvation. They dedicated themselves to helping others understand that hell isn't a place of punishment but rather a chance for personal growth and redemption.

As Susan and Mark continued their mission, they found solace in knowing that even in the afterlife, forgiveness and understanding can change one's destiny. And the demon, with a renewed sense of purpose, continued to guide lost souls, hoping to show them the way to their true selves and ultimate happiness.",LLM,Vicuna-33B,,plan_write,,1,0

For years, he had been known as ""The Clown,"" the go-to entertainer for children's birthday parties and corporate events. But all of that changed when a freak accident involving a lawnmower and a squirrel left him without his signature feature.

Jake tried to laugh, but it sounded more like a snort. Without his nose, he didn't feel like himself anymore. He missed the way it would wiggle and waggle, the way it would light up when he told a joke or made a silly face. He missed the way it made people smile.

As he sat there, feeling sorry for himself, Jake heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find Lola Sanchez, a fortune teller he had met a few times before at various events. She was known for her outrageous outfits and over-the-top personality, but today she looked different. Today, she looked...serious.

""Jake, I've been looking for you everywhere,"" she said, her voice low and urgent. ""I have something that belongs to you.""

She handed him a small package wrapped in brightly colored paper. Jake unwrapped it slowly, his heart racing. Inside, he found a small, red rubber nose.

""This is the Clown's Nose,"" Lola explained. ""It has the power to grant wishes, but not in the way you might expect. It grants them in the funniest way possible.""

Jake looked at the nose skeptically. He had heard rumors of such a nose, but he never thought it was real. But as he held it in his hand, he felt a strange sensation. It was as if the nose was calling to him, urging him to make a wish.

""Go on, Jake,"" Lola encouraged. ""Make a wish. See what happens.""

Jake hesitated for a moment, but then he closed his eyes and made his wish. When he opened them again, he was standing in front of a crowded audience, wearing a bright orange wig and a giant red nose. They were laughing at his antics, their faces bright with joy.

Jake couldn't believe it. He was back! He was entertaining people again, making them laugh and forget their troubles. He felt alive again, like himself once more.

But as the day went on, Jake began to realize that the Clown's Nose had a mind of its own. It would grant wishes in unexpected ways, sometimes turning people's frowns upside down, other times making them laugh so hard they cried.

Jake was both thrilled and terrified by the unpredictability of the nose. He knew he had to be careful what he wished for, or he might end up causing chaos instead of joy.

One day, while performing at a children's hospital, Jake met Officer James Smith, a no-nonsense police officer who was there visiting his sick daughter. At first, Jim was skeptical of Jake's claims about the magical nose, but as he watched Jake perform, he saw the way the children's faces lit up with laughter and happiness.

For the first time in his life, Jim felt a pang of jealousy. He had always been so focused on following the rules and upholding the law that he had forgotten what it was like to experience joy and wonder.

Over the next few weeks, Jim found himself attending more and more of Jake's performances. He started to see the world in a different light, realizing that there was more to life than just following the rules.

One day, Jim approached Jake after a show. ""Jake, can I ask you something?"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

""Sure, Jim. What's up?"" Jake replied, his face still painted with a bright red smile.

""Do you think...do you think the Clown's Nose could grant me a wish? I know it's crazy, but I just...I don't know, I feel like I need a little bit of magic in my life right now.""

Jake looked at Jim with newfound respect. He had always known that the Clown's Nose was special, but he had never realized how much it could affect other people's lives.

""Of course, Jim,"" he said, handing the nose to the officer. ""Just be careful what you wish for. Remember, it grants wishes in the funniest way possible.""

Jim nodded and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. When he opened them again, he was wearing a bright yellow chicken suit and holding a giant pretend egg. The children in the audience were screaming with laughter, and even Jake couldn't help but crack a smile.

From that day forward, Jim became a regular at Jake's performances. He learned to embrace his silly side, and he found a new sense of purpose in life. And every now and then, he would make a wish on the Clown's Nose, just to see what kind of hilarious chaos it would bring.

As for Jake, he continued to entertain people with the help of the magical nose. He knew that it was a gift, one that he would cherish forever. And he knew that no matter where life took him, he would always be able to bring joy and laughter to those around him.",LLM,Llama-2-70B,,plan_write,,1,1

Upon the dusky shelves amidst the dusty relics of time, the ordinary looking marble with a splash of red stood out; posthumously christened ""The Clown's Nose."" Enticing to the eye, its virgin hue a stark contrast against the antiquated background; it promised happy fulfillment of desires, but in the most humorous fashion.

Edmund, a reserved, middle-aged tax auditor, slumped under the weight of routine, happened upon 'The Clown's Nose' during one forgettable day. Notorious for his rigid life, devoid of humor or spontaneous joy, the people of Aberdale often compared him to an old vinyl record stuck in a dreary loop. Intrigued by the marble's seemingly ludicrous legend, he impulsively decided to invoke mirth into his mundane existence.

""I wish I had friends,"" he wished aloud, stroking the Clown's Nose.

Following his wish, Edmund's life took a comic turn. The universe responded, not by introducing charming, charismatic folks into his life; no, it was too simple and too dull for the capricious Clown's Nose. Instead, he found fast friends in an army of jocular ducks that followed him obstinately.

A site that previously triggered yawns now elicited quacks and uproarious laughter. His monotone tax explanations were met with synchronized head tilts, triggering an avalanche of giggles among his clientele. The universe had turned his social life into an absurdist joke written by a wisecracking scribe.

Captivated by the clown's enchanting game, Edmund decided to play on. His next wish was for success, to be at the apex of his career. But the universe, under the influence of the Clown's Nose, pursued a punchline instead of a conventional path. Rather than promotions or profitable accounts, his success emerged as a newfound popularity on the internet. Videos of his duck-ridden shenanigans spread contagion of laughter worldwide turning him into a sensation. That arid tax auditor was now the face of a comically relatable meme: '#NotAQuackJob'.

The Clown's Nose bolstered his appetite for fun. Edmund's final wish on a chilly Sunday sunset was for love. The next morning, he found himself shockingly infatuated, not with a down-to-earth beauty, but with his awkwardly flattering reflection in the puddles he splashed through with his duck companions. A fulfilling self-love, wrapped in giggles and nested in the irony that he had become Aberdale's most loved bachelor.

In course of a few wishes, Edmund's monochrome life was colored not with ordinary rainbows but with wild bursts of neon. His silent abode was filled with the uncontrollable laughter of residents and visitors alike. Once plain, his life was now an unfolding comedic narrative under the divine jokester, the Clown's Nose.

Who would've thought the aloof man of Aberdale would transform into the heart of hilarity? The protagonist of his comically absurd life. Edmund, once just an insignificant figure in the background, had been reshaped into Aberdaleâs crown jewel, making them once again believe in laughterâs ever enchanting magic; an unforgettable chapter scripted by none other than the incredible Clown's Nose.",LLM,GPT-4,,writer_profile,,1,2
2,2,2,3,3,2,674.5979781150818,3,2,Aliens take over the Earth. They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"As the sun rose over the horizon, humans went about their daily routines, oblivious to the alien spaceship hovering ominously above. The ground shook beneath their feet as the massive vessel descended, its hull glowing with an eerie blue light. And then, without warning, a portal opened up in the sky, spewing forth a legion of tall, slender beings. They were unlike anything anyone had ever seen before â their skin a sickly shade of purple, their eyes glowing bright green. 
They were the Zorans, and they had come to claim Earth as their own. With barely a sound, they surrounded the major cities of the world, trapping unsuspecting humans inside their invisible force fields. The Zorans made their demands clear: they would take control of Earthâs government, force humans to work for them a tyrannical four hours a day, four days a week, and provide them with basic necessities like housing and food in exchange for their compliance.
At first, the humans were terrified. They braced themselves for the worst, expecting to be enslaved or worse. But as the Zorans continued to assert their dominance, something unexpected happened. The humans began to...celebrate?
It started small â a few scattered cheers and chants here and there. But soon, it became a full-blown party. Humans danced and sang, waving flags and balloons emblazoned with the Zoran symbol. They even set up a makeshift stage in Times Square, where a group of humans performed an impromptu song and dance number dedicated to their new alien overlords.
The Zorans were taken aback by this turn of events. How could their defeated enemies be so cheerful? Their confusion only grew when they tried to understand why these humans werenât begging for mercy or demanding their freedom. Instead, they saw joy and gratitude in their captorsâ faces. 
As the days passed, the humans and Zorans developed an odd sort of relationship. The aliens ruled with an iron fist, but they also provided their prisoners with a level of care and attention they never thought possible. The humans had food, shelter, and medical attention whenever they needed it â and they were given time off during the week to rest and relax. For some, it almost felt like a vacation. 
Of course, there were still those who longed for their freedom â but they were now a distinct minority. The majority of humans had come to see the Zorans as benefactors, their oppressive regime a necessary evil to keep their bellies full and their heads above water. They saw no reason to fight against their new rulers, content to live out their days in relative peace and comfort. 
As the months turned into years, the humans adapted to their new way of life. They formed a strange bond with their alien overlords, treating them with a mix of respect and fondness. They knew they could never truly escape their rule, but they were grateful for the chance to live without fear. 
And so, the Zorans remained, ruling over Earth with a gentle yet firm hand. It was a strange and unprecedented arrangement, but both sides had found a way to make it work. Perhaps someday, they would find a way to coexist peacefully, free from the chains of war and conquest. Until then, they would simply enjoy the unexpected benefits of living under alien rule.",LLM,Llama-2-7B,,writer_profile,,1,3

As soon as I honked the Clown's Nose, I was suddenly transported to a bizarre dreamscape where everything was covered in brightly colored polka dots. The sky was filled with clown cars flying by, honking their horns in tandem with the nose's haunting, silly melody. I watched in awe as the ground beneath me turned into a giant trampoline, causing me to bounce around like a rubber ball. Before I could process what was happening, a giant clown appeared before me, juggling an endless supply of rubber chickens while riding a unicycle on stilts. He greeted me with a goofy grin and an exaggerated wink, before shouting, ""Your wish has been granted, silly human!""

I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. I had wished for a new car, but instead, I got this bizarre circus scene that made no sense. It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen, and yet, it was also kind of brilliant. Who wouldn't want to live in a world where clowns ruled supreme and wishes were granted with silly, unexpected results?

The clown continued to juggle his chickens while balancing on one foot, a challenge that he seemed to take very seriously. Suddenly, he let out a mischievous giggle and replaced one of the chickens with a rubber hamster. To my amazement, the hamster started to squeak and squirm as if it were real, and the clown caught it with ease.

Just when I thought things couldn't get any stranger, the ground beneath me began to shake, and a giant rubber band came to life. It stretched and bounced around like a giant slinky, sending me flying into the air. As I soared through the polka dot sky, I realized that the Clown's Nose had granted my wish in the funniest way possible. Instead of getting a new car, I got a wild, fantastical adventure that would be remembered for the rest of my life.

As I descended back down to earth, the clown gave me a high-five and a wink before disappearing into thin air. I found myself back in my own backyard, but my perspective had changed. Life wasn't so serious anymore; there was room for play and laughter, even in the most mundane situations. I felt like a kid again, ready to embrace the absurdity of life and all its possibilities. And who knows? Maybe someday I'd find another strange object that would grant my next wish in a hilarious way. The world was full of surprises, and I was ready for whatever came next.",LLM,Llama-2-13B,,writer_profile,,1,4

When you ask what good deed got you into heaven you are informed that this is hell, followed by a visit from a very concerned demon.","I awoke in a place unfettered by temporal bounds, immersed in the sweet scent of honeysuckle, the cool cradle of eternity lapping gently at my senses. The silhouettes of people exchanging warm smiles in the distance, their laughter filling the air with a tune as pleasant as a Mozart symphony. I took in the scene, wrapping myself in their ambient joy, a tranquil sense of wonderment kindling within me.

The aesthetics of this realm surrounded me, greeted me with the same warmth as a thousand summer sunsets. Peace and tranquility, stark contrasts to the life I had known, filled each corner. No burdens of earthly existence, no rigor of survival, no ticking clocks etching away life's fleeting moments. The thick stench of rat race, resentment, and unrest were all glaringly absent. 

To my query of what benevolent act had entitled me to this serenity, a woman, adorned in the raiment of angelic brilliance, looked puzzled. ""Sweet soul, you must have misunderstood,"" she said gently, ""This is indeed Hell, not Heaven."" 

Scanning my eyes for any hints of jest, they only met with earnest. A tinge of discomfort cloaked her heavenly countenance, a stark contradiction to the utopia that was painted around me. This was hell? This place of serenity, where smiles flowed as readily as wine at a banquet?

The silence was broken by the soft patter of footsteps. A figure approached, draped in the shadows of the ethereal setting, yet there was something oddly familiar about him. As he emerged from the shadows, I recognized the form; a demon, the very embodiment of doom as mortal stories had painted. Yet, there was a strange concern etched in his crimson eyes. 

âAh, a new arrival,â he sighed, regret tinging his otherwise sturdy voice. ""I shouldâve been the first to see you.""

I stood still, my understanding grappling with the oddity of a regretful demon in what seemed to be no less than a celestial utopia. He folded his arms tightly across his chest, leaning in, as if preparing himself to share a mournful secret. The air thickened, the world stopped, and the demon spoke words that sent chills along the spine of my consciousness. 

âThis is Hell, but not the one humans have created in their minds. Painful, tormented, dreadful â those are earthly concepts tied to flesh and bone. Here in the ethereal world, we trade only in the currency of emotions. Regret is our eternal bondage, the luxury of amending past mistakes forever out of reach. Unresolved conflict, unexpressed emotions, unfulfilled relationships â this mirage of Paradise is merely the canvas for your eternal regret.â

In this place, free from every strain and stress, there was but one agony that would echo throughout eternity â the pain of what could have been. As his words hung heavy in the air, my paradise was tainted with the bitter taste of longing. I looked around again, seeing the remorse etched subtly in the smiles. 

Underneath the veils of tranquility, I uncovered the true face of Hell. No fire, no brimstone, just an endless expanse of sought redemption denied a lifetime too late. Here, everyone was awash in the glow of their disappointments, even the demon himself â Hell's guardian, and its most regretful inhabitant.",LLM,GPT-4,,writer_profile,,1,5

They then announce that they will be forcing the humans to work a 'tyrannical' 4 hours a day 4 days a week in exchange for basic rights like housing. Needless to say they are very confused when the humans celebrate their new alien overlords.,"The sun rose on a world forever changed. The once-proud people of Earth awoke to find themselves under the rule of a powerful and enigmatic alien race. The blue giants had arrived, and with them came a new order. A tyranny, they called it. But to the weary inhabitants of this battered planet, it felt like a gift.

John Smith was one of those people. A former construction worker, he had spent years shouldering the weight of a crumbling world. The invasion had brought an abrupt end to his exhausting existence. Now, he labored for just four hours a day, four days a week. In exchange, he received a small but comfortable home, food on the table, and the precious gift of time. Time to play with his children, to laugh with his wife, and to live a life that was finally his own.

He had joined the resistance at first, swayed by the impassioned words of Dr. Lila Grey. But as the weeks turned into months, John began to see the world through new eyes. The aliens had given him a chance to be human again. To remember what it was like to enjoy a summer's evening or to watch the sun set without the crushing burden of ceaseless toil.

Dr. Lila Grey, however, remained steadfast in her opposition to the alien occupation. Her heart burned with righteous fury, driving her to gather the remnants of the resistance and lead them in a desperate struggle against their oppressors.

Commander Rythor watched from afar, bewildered by the humans' celebration of their new chains. The aliens had intended to break the spirit of the Earth's people, to subdue them through relentless labor and ceaseless servitude. Yet the humans welcomed their new overlords with open arms. Rythor could not understand this, but as it observed the contented masses, it began to question its own beliefs. Perhaps there was more to these creatures than their savage past.

One day, John happened upon a group of protesters led by Dr. Lila Grey. Their voices rose in defiance, demanding freedom from the alien yoke. A familiar surge of anger rose within him, but he felt a calming hand on his shoulder. It was his wife, her eyes filled with love and understanding.

""They have given us back our lives, John,"" she said softly. ""Can we not give them a chance?""

In that moment, John made a choice. He would not fight the aliens, nor would he support them. Instead, he would live his life, embracing the opportunity they had given him while never forgetting the spirit of the resistance.

As Commander Rythor watched from a distance, it saw John and his wife walking hand in hand, their faces upturned to the sky. The alien commander wondered if it had misunderstood these creatures all along. Were they truly the savages it had always believed them to be? Or was there something deeper, something worth saving, beneath their scarred surface?

In the end, the alien invasion had brought not just conquest but also a chance for redemption. For both the people of Earth and their enigmatic masters, the blue giants who had come to shape their destiny. Together, they would learn the true meaning of freedom, and the infinite possibilities that lay within the human heart.",LLM,Llama-2-7B,,writer_profile,,1,6
